Guys, attached you will find a preliminary agenda for the 2000 ENA Offsite.
As leaders of the organization, you have been invited to participate in a two  day offsite where business 2001 objectives and strategies for ENA will be  discussed.
It is scheduled to occur December 14th and 15th at the Venetian  in Las Vegas.
This is the forum to ensure that your point of view and ideas can be heard  and incorporated into our plans and iniatives as such I would encourage  everyone to attend and to stay for the entire period.
In particular, we  would like everyone to stay over Friday night and leave Saturday morning.
ENA public relations (Dorie) will manage all the logistics including air fare.
Final invitations, details and agenda will follow shortly.
Regards
