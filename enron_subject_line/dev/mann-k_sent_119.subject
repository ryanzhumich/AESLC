Hi Kathy,  Here are my suggestions/comments on Rev.
6  Definitions.
I think we need a Business Day definition, and a search and  replace of business days for Business Days.
1.55 The definition of Performance Tests is really a definition of  performance test reports.
I think we need a definition that incorporates the  tests listed on Exhibit E.  The phrase installation option is used, but I didn't find a description of  the installation option when I did a search.
3.14.2.1  Is 6 months enough under this circumstances?
Does it matter?
4.3  Delete "Each".
5.1  The amounts on Exhibit N don't match what I have on the last option  agreement, and there isn't a description of any options, unless I'm  interpretting it incorrectly.
5.3 (ii)  add "as provided in Section  5.5"  6.4  I may have missed this, but I didn't see where amounts owed by Seller  would be charged interest if not timely paid.
10.7  Are the roman numerals correct?.
I am going to email you some new language for assignment and the buy back  option.
You should have it today.
Do you have a redline on this rev 6 versus whatever the version was I read  before?
I'm skimming it and I want to make sure I don't skip something.
Thanks,
