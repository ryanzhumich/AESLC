On Feb 7, we sold 10,000 to Duke Energy Field Services at Waha.
However, I  entered the deal (#603484) under Duke Energy Marketing (Can you believe I  made a mistake?).
To correct this, I created a new ticket (#700132) under  DEFS.
Mary - Please repath these deals and let Megan know when you're done.
Sorry for the extra work.
