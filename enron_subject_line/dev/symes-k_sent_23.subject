I know I already discussed time off at Christmas with you, but I have really  indecisive parents who are divorced and like to do completely opposite things  for the holidays, so I have one modification to make.
If I could take off  from Friday, Dec. 22, to Tuesday, Jan 2, then I can accomodate both of my  parents and head off a potentially disastrous fight over which kids go with  which parents.
It ends up being two more days off than I had asked for before  -  the 22nd and the 2nd.
I'm really sorry to ask for so much time off, but I  wouldn't do it unless my life were going to be in jeopardy if I didn't.
Thank  you!
Kate
