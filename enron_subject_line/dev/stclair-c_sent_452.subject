Brant: We are trying to finalize the agreement that does the following:  1.
Transfers all of the ENA/Oneok Gas Marketing Company trades and the Oneok  Gas Marketing Master from Onoek Gas Marketing Company to  Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. (formerly KN Marketing LP); 2.
Terminates the Oneok Energy Marketing Master and makes all Oneok Energy  and Oneok Gas Marketing trades subject to the Onoek Gas Marketing Master.
Here is what I need to know from you:  1.
Is there a new Oneok Inc. Guaranty for $30,000,000 that covers these  trades?
If so, please fax me a copy.
2.
Is there a new Enron Guaranty and if not, what happens to the 2 existing  Enron Guarantees that currently support the Onoek Energy Master and the Oneok  Gas Marketing Master?
Please advise.
Carol
