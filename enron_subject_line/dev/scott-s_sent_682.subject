Gwen,  Dolores Muzzy gave me your name as a contact for information regarding the  redesigned Analyst/Associate programs.
I am currently half-way through my  second rotation with the Analyst program and was hoping to get a better idea  of the different opportunities available to me upon completion of my current  rotation.
Although six months seems like a fair amount of time to plan my  next move, I know how quickly it will pass and do not want to find myself  uncertain as to what action to take to insure that I am heading in the right  direction to meet my current goals.
I would appreciate the opportunity to  meet with you and discuss the aforementioned topics at your earliest  convenience.
If there is another individual you feel would be a better  contact for me at this point I would be happy to meet with them as well.
Thank you,
