This e-mail is to confirm what we discussed and decided at today's trading meeting.
Going forward, we are splitting the fundies meeting into two parts.
The first part will be from about 1 until 1:30 with Tim H. reviewing all of the routine fundamental slides.
The second part of the meeting will include only the people on this e-mail.
During that part of the meeting, which will run from approximately 1:30 until 2:30, we will discuss specific trading matters.
If there is anyone who works for you that has been going to the fundies meeting but will not be attending the smaller trading meeting please let them know about the new approach.
We remain committed to sharing the fundies information with a broad group people while trying to create a time and place where the smaller trading team can talk through trading issues.
Thanks,
