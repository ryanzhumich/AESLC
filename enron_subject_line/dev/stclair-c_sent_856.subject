Steve: It has come to my attention that we made need another agreement similar to  the one that we did with the ANNEX A form to cover the GTC's that Puget is  bound by when it trades online with us.
I have enclosed the online GTC.
It  is very similar to Annex A but I think that we need to deal with it  separately.
Let me know what you think.
