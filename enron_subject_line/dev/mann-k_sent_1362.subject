Hi Jordan,  I support ENA's Chicago group in their activities with Peoples.
Peoples and  Enron have a jointly (50/50) owned company called enovate, which will be  involed in managing some of Peoples assets and some trading activities.
Each  of the parents will be establishing a line of credit to cover cash flow.
It  is expected that Corp will be lending the money for Enron's part, and Sarah  Wesner has been involved in the process.
Therefore, I thought it would be a  good idea to run this transaction through your group for  blessing/comment/sign off/whatever is appropriate.
I can give additional  information to whoever you decide should take a look at this.
Thanks,
