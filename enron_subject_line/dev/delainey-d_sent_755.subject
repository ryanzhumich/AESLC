John, I asked Brian to investigate taking a number of ESA's engineering folks  into his central Technical Services group.
These folks would continue to  work on ESA's projects but would get the resources and support of the  centralized body particularily in their negotiations with outside vendors  including NEPCO and OEC.
It would also be another linkage into the SAmerican  business from Houston to help monitor and defray technical and development  risk.
Lets see if Kishkill and Redmond get to the right answer.
