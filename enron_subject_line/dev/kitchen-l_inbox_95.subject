Hello  Long time no see or hear!!
Thank you for sending me a note - I've only just got into this e mail lark as we didn't have it on the computors at work until this year - and then I'm not supposed to be using it oh well.
How is America?
I had no idea that you where there or that you had  had a baby, Denise came to Majorca this summer and she filled me in on peoples whereabouts.
How old is you little boy and what's his name.
It's winter season here and very little work to do - that's why I am e mail mad  to try and fill in my time.
Only got 2 days left and then I am finished until Feb, depending on how things go with bookings etc after New York.
I usually go home for Christmas every year but my nana died  at the beginning of the year and now we don't have a base to stay (me, sally and mum) so i am going home on the 8th of Dec until the 18th and having Christmas here instead.
My mum has been here for 2 years now, well 2 summers and a bit of winter.
she originally came to help me with Louisa just after she was born as I went back to work when she was 3 months and mum looked after her for me during the day, but now as she hasn't got nana to look after she decided to come back and helps me out a lot as my hours are not always a straight 9-5.
Louisa goes to nursery during the week  and mum and I juggle the hours between us ( I say mum and I as Toni is about as useful as a chocolate fireguard )  My sister is an art director for Vidal Sasson, doing very well for herself, she runs the new salon in the city in London and is always jetting of to Japan and other exciting `places, still single no children but loves Louisa to bits.
Anyway enough about me, how is life in America,  do you work or are you a lady of leisure?
Louisa is nearly 3, but I imagine your little boy isn't at school yet is he?
does he look like you or your husband?
Louisa is blond with blue eyes, nothing like either myself or Toni - she is very much like my sister and my dad.
I have been at the hospital today to see a specialist with her as she was born with a lump in her neck (which he has told us will have to be removed in later years) she also has a mark on the back of her head and a birthmark between her lip and her nose which a lot of people comment about but I am very used to.
She has noe to go and see another specialist about these 2 things and then hopefully eveything will be sorted out, apart from that ahe is nearly 3 but every thinks she is at least 4 as she is very tall and well built unfortuanately the only thing she has got from her father is his Majorcian temperment!!
Say hello to your mum and dad and Paul, if you are in the Uk at the same time as me let me know as I would love to see you all.
Bye for now  Love Jo and Louisa  xxx
