Kim,  Attached are the revised documents for Palo Alto.
The documents are  revised to reflect the deal term comments that the City forwarded.
I changed  the name of the document to Natural Gas Services Agreement to address their  concerns about a non commodity agreement.
I have also added language  requiring a City Council resolution to for this document.
Instead of a legal  opinion, we would require the City Attorney to approve both the Natural Gas  Services and Transaction Agreements.
In included a redline of the services  agreement from the prior version.
The Transaction Agreement would not  redline on MS word for some reason.
I will request my assistant to redline  it for you on Monday using comparewrite.
If you need help prior to my  return, please coordinate with Jeff Hodge.
Please forward these documents to  the City if you are okay with them.
Thanks.
