Kevin,  I just wanted to mention a few things.
I'm sure you are doing them already  most of the time, but they really need to be done on each and every deal.
Link all physical Tagg deals by putting the Sitara number in the LINK field Put the Tagg number in the comments section of any Sitara deal also booked in  Tagg Put the Tagg number in SCI for any Sitara deal also booked in Tagg Put the EOL number in Sitara and/or Tagg for every EOL deal Also, in Tagg there is a System of Origin field - Select Enron on Line for  every EOL deal Manually rebook every EOL deal that fails - If you have trouble doing this,  just let me know and I'll follow up.
Thanks.
