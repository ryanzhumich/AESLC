Hi Mark,  I would like to creat a product for Enron Online for trades on Alliance  Pipeline.
As you probably know, Alliance is a new pipeline scheduled to  start commercial service effective November 13, 2000.
As with any new  pipeline, this date may or may not be pushed back to a later date.
I would  like to create a product that has a description that addresses the  uncertainty of the start-up date of Alliance Pipeline and simply states that  gas will commence flowing when the pipeline goes commecial.
Please let me know if you have language that addresses this situation.
I would like to get this product set up as soon as possible.
Thank you
