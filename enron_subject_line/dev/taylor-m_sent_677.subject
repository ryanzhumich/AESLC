Hi Marc!
Yes, we're having a few friends over Sat.
night for "Holiday Cheer" which at  our house means cocktails by the Christmas tree and maybe some of my  wonderful-tasting but horrible-for-you egg nog.
We'd love to see you guys.
It's just an 8 to 10 kind of thing so even if you have other parties to go  to, you could make this one the kick-off.
The extent of FABULOUS in our Y2K plans is in the price of the bottle of  champagne we're going to share at home that night.
I asked T if we should  plan anything and got the "quiet night at home" reply.
That, of course, will  change to "Why didn't you plan anything?!"
around 12/29 or 30.
How's BMC?
What are you doing for them?
Do you know Clayton Williams?
I  think he still works there.
Give us a call so we can catch up.
Tell G we said hi & hope to see you  Saturday!
