I will be in San Antonio attending an offsite meeting hosted by Rick Causey  on Wednesday and Thursday, September 13 through 15.
I will leave the offsite  meeting before its conclusion on Friday, so that I can attend a lunch meeting  with Philippe Bibi, Rick Buy, Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford to discuss common  needs around risk systems.
I will be in the office the afternoon of  September 15.
Patti Thompson, my assistant (x39106), will have telephone numbers where I  can be reached.
