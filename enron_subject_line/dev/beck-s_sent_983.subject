Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.
I have the dubious  honor of being here late enough on Friday night to have seen the arrival of  the promotional memo via e:mail.
I will be in the London office next week  and I believe that we have some time scheduled together.
I look forward to  the chance to visit with you then.
