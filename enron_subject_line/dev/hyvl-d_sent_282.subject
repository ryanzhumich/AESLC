Bob Bruce has set up a meeting with Ken Raceler to go over the changes that  went into effect 12/21 of last year.
They will meet on March 5th from 1 to 3  p.m. at the Hyatt Regency - Sandelwood Room A.
He says that eventhough they  are trying to keep the group small it makes sense that you and I attend.
He  did say that space was not a problem.
I told him that you and I did want to  attend if for no other reason than to find out about the gray areas that we  still need to be watchful of.
i.e.
who is an "eligible contract participant"  under the revised law.
What representations need ot be made, if any, by the  customer?
