Mark,  Two points.
1.
You probably know about it already.
ABHAY MEHTA, the author of "Power  Play", is on a tour of the United States.
Please, take a look at the information about a  meeting last Sunday  at Stanford University.
The web site address is  given below.
My wife went to the presentation and told me it was quite critical about Enron.
About 40  people attended.
2.
I was approached by John Martin, a professor of finance at Baylor, to  write jointly an academic paper on Enron for a financial journal.
He wanted to work on an  article on EBS.
I have suggested a different topic: Enron - Case Study of a Company  Reinventing Itself.
I made a few points to John:  a. Enron's evolution did not just happen  by accident.
It was a result of implementation of a far-reaching strategy developed by the management.
b.
In the process of its evolution Enron changed its environment.
I came up  with a term "proactive evolution", as opposed to "reactive evolution."
c. The strategy included many elements, including emphasis on the quality of human resources, changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee empowerment.
d. There are very few companies that match Enron's experience and  accomplishemnts.
The paper could become a standard reading at the MBA courses on corporate  strategy and would help greatly our recruiting efforts.
Writing the paper would require interviews with Ken, Jeff and a few other key  players.
Let me know what you thing about it.
John is really excited about this paper.
