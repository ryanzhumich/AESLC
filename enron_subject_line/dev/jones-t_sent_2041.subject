We have received a revised Unanimous Consent of Directors dated 8/28/00  ("Board Resolution") from the referenced Counterparty which expands the  approval given in their initial Board Resolution (provided when we executed  the ISDA Master Agreement) to allow them to enter into "pulp, lumber and  paper commodity price swap and options, and other commodity price swap and  option transactions"  with ENA.
For ClickPaper, this should allow them to trade all the financial products we  trade.
For EnronOnline, this should allow them to trade all commodity swaps  and options.
If Credit will add this to the next spreadsheets for both  ClickPaper and EnronOnline, I will amend my approval.
I will circulate a copy of the revised Board Resolution to Global Contracts  and Camille Gerard.
