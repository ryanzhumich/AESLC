We will be implementing an additional confirm process going forward.
All broker deals will be booked by Risk and placed in TAGG to generate a confirmation.
Before the confirmation is sent to the counterparty, the Enron trader will sign off on the confirm.
All broker deals will be handled this way.
Please generate a new daily summary report of all broker deals by trader in the west region.
This will allow me to verify if the new process is being handled properly.
Anne, please communicate this to your group.
Thanks,
