So what's happening today?
Are you involved in ranking stuff, like Kim?
That's all so much fun.
I think Armin and I should have a ranking meeting, he would get some low marks in the courteous office behavior..when he gets stressed he turns into...ISOLDE!!!!
Maybe if I threaten his bonus he would work to improve that one little imperfection.
And of course I need no improvement in ANY catagory, I'm just perfect (I'm sure he will agree..ha ha haaaa).
Angus would get the best rating from both of us, he is perfect in our eyes.
I think Angus may be in trouble with the workers though...i let him out to do his business while ago and the workers had their lunches sitting out, I'm afraid to ask them if he helped himself to their food...he's really bad about that!
He got on my desk one afternoon while Armin and I were outside and dined on some M&M's that were in a cup on my desk...there were only like 5 in the cup and when we came back in, I found one partially licked one on my desk and one on Armin's...of course he was sick that night.
We are finally getting warmer wetter again, oops that's weather in english.
I was able to take off my coat at lunch time, hopefully tomorrow the thermals can go too.
I hope Julie has been having better weather in Prague...but I think not.
Have ya'll heard from her?
I thought she might call us since she's on the continent...  Did you tell her about talking to your parents?
She told me that she told you her secret.
Were you surprised?
I actually guess who it was, but I was surprised!
Last I heard she didn't know their status....did she ever find out?
Well, write me!!!!
