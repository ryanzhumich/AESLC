Steve,   Thanks for the voicemail.
I was surprised that you were not up to speed  (although I probably shouldn't be).
Please talk with Joe and get is view on  this.
I left michael an email on my view, which is that it looks very early  and I don't think it is worth our time or money at this point.
Certainly he  wants to maintain a good relationship and watch them and maybe you can help  with that.
Let me know if you get any other news.
Thanks,
