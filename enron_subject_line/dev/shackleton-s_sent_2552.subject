Many of you have been involved in recent efforts to either amend documents to  provide for rehypothecation of securities or additional collateral  arrangements, both resulting from cash constraints in the market.
In that  regard, it appears that our credit group will be very interested in accepting  different forms of government obligations, including Treasury Bills, Treasury  Notes and Treasury Bonds.
Our current version of Paragraph 13 does not have  the "choice" for Eligible Collateral consisting of longer dated obligations  such as Treasury Notes and Bonds; our earlier version did provide this  option.
LEGAL:  When preparing new master agreements, please be specific about credit  requests to include securities and verify with credit the specific types of  Eligible Collateral to be included in Paragraph 13.   CREDIT:  When drafting credit worksheets, please be  specific when requesting  types of Eligible Collateral other than cash.
We may consider amending Paragraph 13 again or adding additional forms of  Eligible Collateral to Library Doc.
