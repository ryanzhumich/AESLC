Please note that Wall 2 Wall has been delayed and will be in tomorrow instead of today.
Sorry for any inconvenience.
Carla   With the recent shuffle of people moving to new desks, I'm sure there will be keyboard trays that need to be moved, as well as some repairs.
Wall 2 Wall will be in on Wednesday afternoon to look after this.
Please let me know by Wednesday morning if you need anything done.
Thanks,
