Clem,  Attached is the resume of my dear friend, Carolyn Varela.
Carolyn started  working at Liddell, Sapp, Zivley, Hill & LaBoon a few months before I did in  1984 (while I left after 10 years for the greener pastures of Enron!).
Before coming to Liddell, Sapp, Carolyn was a Corporate Paralegal at Texas  Commerce Bank, one of the principal clients of Liddell, Sapp, and was a key  contact for handling the TCB relationship over the years along with the  primary lawyer she worked for, Mr. LaBoon, who maintained the TCB  relationship for the law firm.
Carolyn is a kind, cheerful person, a hard worker and a pleasure to be  around.
I was in the Municipal Bond Group and she was in the Corporate  Group, but we frequently backed each other up (as well as the Real Estate and  Lending teams) on closings, proofreading documents, large filings, etc.
I  think she would be a great asset to your team and Enron.
