Clement, Enron Corp. currently has an executed guaranty for up to $12 mil  which guaranties Bridgeline Gas Marketing LLC deals with Superior Natural Gas  Corporation.
ENA owns 40% of Bridgeline.
The guaranty severally obligates  Enron Corp. for 40% of the $12 mil and Texaco Inc. for the other 60%.
The  attached amendment increases the guaranty amount to $25 mil per Superior's  request.
Please review and if acceptable obtain execution by Enron Corp.
Please call me at x-33512 with any questions.
Brant,  This form will probably work for the Texaco guaranty also.
I don't  have a copy of the Texaco guaranty though and I need to review it to make  sure it is identical to the Enron form.
Can you obtain a copy for me?
