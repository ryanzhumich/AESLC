Hi Elizabeth,  I've had a couple of originators approach me about working on asset  management type deals, optimizing third parties' power assets and/or  purchase/sale of commodities.
A little birdie told me that you worked on  something somewhat similiar to that a while back, but the deal didn't go.
When you have a minute I would appreciate hearing about what you did.
Thanks,
