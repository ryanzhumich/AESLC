I talked to Ray Bowen today regarding the Finance Comm.
book.
He and Jeff will combine the old CFO and Treasurer's report into one Finance Report.
Please make a placeholder on the agenda.
The materials will most likely be handed out at the meeting, so please put in a sheet saying that behind their tab.
Thanks to each of you for your diligence on this effort.
