The kids and I are arriving at 9:45am on Thursday.
Because of work  commitments, Kristi is arriving at 12:30pm.
The 3 of us will get a rental  car and make our way to your place.
Are you going to be home then?
Then we  will go pick up Kristi later.
We have no plans at the moment (other than  going to the game on Saturday).
We are leaving on Sunday at an awful time,  though, 6:30am.
They didn't give me many options using reward travel.
We  are all looking forward to the trip.
See you on Thursday.
