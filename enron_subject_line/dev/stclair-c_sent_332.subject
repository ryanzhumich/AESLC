Joyce: I am working on the ETA amendment letter which I hope to send to you  shortly.
We have a new procedure here where every amendment needs to be  signed off by the head of the Online group so I need to get their blessing  before I send it on to you.
Since most if not all of our issues were more  legal in nature I don't foresee a problem with this.
