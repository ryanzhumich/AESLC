The West traders have requested a new pub posting code to allow them to do  deals against the Dow Jones Palo Verde Sunday index.
In particular, Matt  Motley, our Long Term Southwest trader, has executed a deal today for Cal'01  through Cal'06 at the Palo Verde index price.
It runs all days and all hours,  so we need to enter three legs - one at the on peak price, one at off peak,  and one at Sunday price.
The 24-hour Sunday price is the only option missing  from EnPower.
Matt has asked that we get this pub code in as soon as possible  so his deal can be entered and calced tonight.
Please let me know what you  can do.
Thanks,
