Fran,  I understand from John Blaylock that I am to direct an email to you  regarding the treatment of certain vested Enron benefits.
My name was  included on the list of attorneys and paralegals with whom AEP could talk to  regarding possible employment for continuation of legal representation for  HPL's business lines.
I met with Gary Prescott yesterday and do not know  whether AEP will or will not make an offer.
However, in the event they elect  to make an offer, I would like to know what my options are relating to (1) my  vested Enron stock options, (2) any unvested options, (3) the Enron Savings  Plan.
Regarding the Savings Plan, would I be allowed to leave the funds in  the plan, as if I had retired, or would I be required or permitted to roll  those amounts into a rollover IRA?
What actions would I need to take  regarding the amounts that are in the Deferred Compensation Plan?
Enron is currently subsidizing a portion of the costs of internet services  through Time Warner Roadrunner.
Will these costs continue to be subsidized,  and if so, by whom?
