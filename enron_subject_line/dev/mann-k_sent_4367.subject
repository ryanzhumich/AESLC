Wilson,  We are trying to finalize this transaction by next Tuesday, and I could  really use your help.
I believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter?
Also, do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week?
I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities  obligation to financially support MDEA is sufficient.
Thank you,
