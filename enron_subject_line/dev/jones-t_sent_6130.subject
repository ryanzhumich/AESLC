At Wendi's request, I have submitted a request to get you both edit access to  the Financial Trading Agreement Database.
In the meantime, below is the icon  that will allow you to have view access to everything but the comments.
I  will let you know when your edit access is approved (at which time you will  be able to input changes/comments, as well as be able to see comments).
