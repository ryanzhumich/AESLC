We are parking gas in Egan on the 30th (deal 508572) and taking it out  rateably in January (deal 508582).
ENA will pay EGAN $.22 x total volume  parked.
These deals are seperate form the Nov-Dec parking deals.
Currently, I show we are parking a total of 145,052 (to be taken out in  December) and a whopping 48,025 (to be taken out in January).
Lia, please make sure these volumes show up on Texas Gas - let me know if you  have questions.
Thanks
