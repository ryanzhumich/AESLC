Please put this on your calendars - I would like for both of you to attend.
Should Jeff and Stacey be there, too?
This will be a meeting that we should  have regularly with Wes and team so that can jointly review any exposures and  make timely decisions on how to handle those.
I am sure that there is some  prep work that needs to be done for this meeting.
I would assume that we  should cover A/R, UA4, imbalances, weird or over/undervalued deals in risk  books, OA, etc.
Can you work with Greg and Georgeanne ahead of time on  content and have necessary back up to discuss highlights.
I would love for  us take charge and lead this meeting.
