FYI.
From our folks in Sacramento:  AB 1085 is AES' competitive default provider bill.
It's not an emergency  bill, so it will be dealt with throughout the remainder of the spring and  summer.
AB 57 is a legislator's suggestions on how long-term contracts should be  "regulated."
Also no an emergency bill.
AB18X is an emergency bill and it would create a core/noncore split in  electricity similar to the one that exists in California's gas market.
Best,

Legislation:  competitive default provider; long-term contracts;  core/noncore split in electricity
