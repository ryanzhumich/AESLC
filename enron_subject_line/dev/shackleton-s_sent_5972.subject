All:  Effective March 19, 2001,  AESC and ENA entered into a "Side Letter  Agreement" which is an ISDA Master Agreement from a legal perspective.
ENA  and AESC have agreed this morning to negotiate and execute a new ISDA Master  Agreement by April 13, 2001.
Until that date, however, we can confirm  financial trades between ENA and AESC under the Side Letter Agreement.
Attached below is a markup of an ISDA form of confirmation which contains  language for these confirmations (the draft was prepared for Kim Hundl  handling financial power).
Please let me know if you have any questions.
