For those of you that do not know, we are planning greg's bachelor party for the weekend of May 19th.
We've rented a beach house in Surfside.
The beach house is front row on the portion of the beach that allows open fires and automobiles on the beach...both very cool things.
We have the house Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday.
Jeff, Greg, and I will probably arrive Friday night, however the main shindig will get kicked off on Saturday night.
I don't exactly know what the main shindig is, but we realize that most people won't be able to pull themselves away from their miserable lives for an entire weekend.
Jeff, Greg, and I however, will make sure that the keg is working properly friday evening.
So what I need from you is a confirmation that you will: A - Be there Friday and Saturday B - Be there Sometime Saturday, Leave sometime Saturday C - Be there Saturday, Leave Sunday D - Can't make it.
Dallas is too far from Surfside.
Cost will be $625 for the house for the entire weekend.
So depending on how many people we get the price should be between $60-$100 per person.
Each person will be responsible for their own food, and a sleeping bag/pillow, etc.
No linens are provided, (I'm assuming this means no towels either) but I think they have a grill so that's the important thing.
Greg will confirm.
Cards, Dominoes', booze, beach shit, etc.
are other good items to bring.
We will send specific directions at a later time.
Let me know your status so we can get a better handle on costs.
I will pass on more info (costs/directions) as we get it.
Later.
