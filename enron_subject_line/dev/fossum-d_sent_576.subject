Steve Anderton called today and has cleared the arbitration with his firm's  conflict committee.
He's sending an email tomorrow describing the specific  results of his conflict check.
I'll forward it to you both for review.
From  my discussions with Steve, I think he'd do a great job as our arbitrator.
Are we all in agreement on using Steve or are there some other competing  candidates?
Do you guys want to talk to him or meet with him first?
Britt,  do we need a retention agreement with Steve if we decide to use him?
A  self-serving retention agreement may be a good idea if we think OneOk might  challenge our arbitrator based on alleged bias.
Also, if we are good to go  with Steve, I'd like to send him a package of the key documents and then meet  with him to discuss the case sometime in the next week or two.
Britt, any  concerns with my doing that as long as I don't send him anything privileged?
(I'm assuming for the sake of safety that the attorney client privilege  doesn't apply to our communications with our arbitrator unless instructed  otherwise).
He is down in Houston two days a week so we could do it there.
