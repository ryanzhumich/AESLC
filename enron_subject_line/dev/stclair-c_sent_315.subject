Nedre: Per your request, here is what we have decided:  1.
Our 2 best candidates were Jackie McCoy and Samantha Boyd.
As I mentioned  to you, Mark will be talking to HR about making an offer to Samantha Boyd but  until she formally accepts, we don't want to lose Jackie or say anything to  her.
2.
We have passed on the following candidates:  Stephanie Panus Patricia Slaughter Donald Duhon Debra Vincent   Of this group, we may pass on to other groups that have expressed interest   to Mark Taylor in hiring for a non-legal position, the resumes of Stephanie  Panus and Debra Vincent and certainly Jackie McKoy if Samantha accepts.
It  would be helpful to know from you when these particular  passed over  candidates have been notified so that we don't cause confusion if we send  their resume elsewhere.
Also, do you have references for Samantha?
Please call me if you need any additional information.
Carol
