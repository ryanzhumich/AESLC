We recently did about 20 weather trades with Vitol and I "confirmed" these  under the 1995 energy price swap master (bad for weather) but incorporated  ISDA definitions.
I think we should work toward replacing this master with  an ISDA to eliminate the problem.
We did the same with Aquila which solved  the weather problem (and I realize the Aquila is a bigger trading partner  than Vitol).
Can someone generate credit?
Thanks.
