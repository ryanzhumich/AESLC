Guys, I would like to schedule a one hour meeting to discuss the 2000 and  2001 IT budget.
Essentially, I would like this first meeting to discuss our  approach to a) understanding in some detail our 2000 costs and the  nature/behaviour of those costs and b) in this context, ENA's priorities and  the system plan, come up with the 2001 budget and how the accountability will  be managed.
Kay, can you please try to organize ASAP.
Regards
