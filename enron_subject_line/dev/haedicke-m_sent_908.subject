Please let me know as soon as possible if you are aware of any such contracts  as described below by Sharon Butcher.
"The U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Government Contracting has  advised that on May 25, 2001, they will evaluate Enron's subcontracting  program and compliance on any subcontracting plans in effect on current  contracts.
This review will cover the last five (5) years.
All Forms 294 and 295 filed  with the Small Business Adminstration along with the names of each  Administrative Contracting Officer (U.S. Government employee responsible for  monitoring the contract) for each contract will be subject to the review.
In addition, total subcontract placement with small businesses, small  disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, and HubZone small  businesses shall be reviewed.
Further, the amount of indirect or overhead  costs, if any, apportioned to contract goals is subject to review.
We will also need information on the number of active suppliers Enron is  currently using in the following categories:  large business, small business,  small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business and HubZone  business.
The review will cover these figures for one year ago if available."
