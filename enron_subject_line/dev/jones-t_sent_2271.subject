A few news flashes re: limitations on products:  1.
The only parties that can trade Argentina physical gas are Argentina  counterparties.
They have licensing requirements similar to US physical  power.
All existing counterparties that are not Argentinian should be shut  down for this product.
2.
Mark Taylor just found out in a meeting with the tax guys that only ENA  can only enter into credit derivates with US counterparties.
