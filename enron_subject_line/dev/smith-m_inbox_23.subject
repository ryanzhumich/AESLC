All:  As you all know that the DRN within a pipeline should be unique, the DRN_description should be too.
Otherwise it will cause aggregation errors in our reports, values with the same DRN_description within a pipeline are all summed  together.
I have created a query called qry_Mulri_DRN_Names in the Access database O:\Fundy_ops\ReportSetting.mdb (Access 2000), You can run this query to find out how many duplicates there are, and which pipeline they are.
If you entered those duplicates, you can work with Hyde or Eddie to have them corrected.
Please also pay special attention when you enter new DRN and their  descriptions.
The rule is No Duplicate DRN or DRN descriptions are allowed within the same pipeline.
When in doubt, you can always run the query mentioned above to check duplicates.
Let me know if you have questions.
Thanks.
