Jeff, Stacy and Harry:  We have developed a form of multi-product counterparty Guaranty that is a  little different from our old form of counterparty Guaranty.
The main  difference is the deletion of the 15 day cure period in Section 2.
Can you  please take a look at this and let me know if you are okay with this as  something credit can send to counterparties?
Thanks.
