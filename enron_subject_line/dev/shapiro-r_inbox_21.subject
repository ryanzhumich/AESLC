Jim: Attached are two Gov't.
Affairs Org.
charts, the first being the corpo= rate structure( led by me) that needs to be approved by Whalley and Kean; t= he second chart being for  ENA/EES ( led by Steffes) that is in the process=  of being approved by the Offices of the Chair of both business units.
The = corporate budget is approximately $2.575 million( seven professionals and t= wo support staff) while the EES/ENA budget is approximately $6.425 million(=  twenty one professionals and three support staff).
(These budgets  include = a million or so of "mitigatable" real estate leases) The corporate staff wo= uld do the following that I believe is absolutely essential( this reflects = minimal staffing and " barebones" effort): 1) Management for Enron of regul= atory approvals processes for PGE sale and Dynegy Acquisition and any other=  asset sales that may occur( 3-3.5 FTE);2) Retention of skeletal Washington=  Legislative presence(two employees with no outside services support) to en= sure that Enron's interests on Capitol Hill and with the Administration are=  minimally protected and advanced.
Issues include energy legislation(RTO's,=  etc..), CFTC-related issues; tax issues;etc....;3) .5-1.0 FTE to manage al= l residual issues related to non EES/ENA businesses and issues; and 4) one = person to mange all state legislative and local(  including, but not limite= d to Texas and the City of Houston) issues relating to entire company.=20          Jim Steffes will bring the EES/ENA budget to closure while I'll lo= ok for direction from you and Steve as to how to quickly bring the corporat= e piece to closure with Whalley.
I can't emphasize enough that this is the = absolute minimum staffing I could in good conscience recommend.
(Overall,for=  North America this represents a 74% reduction in the budget 2001($33 milli= on) to 2002($9 million) Thanks for all your help.
