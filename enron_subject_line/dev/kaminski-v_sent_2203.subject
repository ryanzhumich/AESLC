Darrell,  Grant Masson, Ronnie Chahal and myself made a contribution to the book on energy derivatives to be published soon in Australia (a book by Clewlow and Strickland).
Given our growing workload and responsibilities, the quality of the paper is  less than satisfactory.
I would like to make sure that there are no obvious and embarrassing  errors in what we submit.
I would appreciate if you could  take a quick look at the chapter and give us the feedback (under the same arrangement as in the previous cases).
Thanks for looking at our storage model.
I shall give you a call within the next few days to update you on our work and developments at Enron.
Vince will start his senior year in 6 weeks.
He wants to graduate and look for work: he thinks getting an advanced degree in his field makes no economic sense.
He spent the summer building his own computer (1000 MHz clock speed).
I was the unskilled immigrant worker toiling under his management.
I hope everything is well at home and that your wife's company is doing great.
Regards.
