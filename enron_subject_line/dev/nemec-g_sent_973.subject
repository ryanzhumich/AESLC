I have reviewed the Oneok Westex Transmission Agreement.
The only comment I  have is that the daily balance cashout requirements in Section F of the  General Terms and Conditions seem very burdensome.
This is really a business  call, but the 5% tolerance or cashout everyday might be difficult to  maintain.
I will leave that to you to decide Stacey.
I am OK with  everything else.
