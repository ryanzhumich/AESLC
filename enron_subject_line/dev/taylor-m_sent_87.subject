Peter:  I understand from Tana that you disagree with the advice we have received  from outside counsel (Stikeman) regarding the necessary  procedures/formalities involved in the taking and holding of cash as  collateral in Canada.
We are in the process of revising our Canadian forms  for ISDA master agreements and credit support annexes.
Would you mind  checking into this issue - maybe by discussing your difference of opinion  with Stikeman (I think the advice came from Fred Erickson in their Calgary  office)?
I don't want to make our forms overly complicated or impose burdens  on ourselves that aren't required by law.
Thanks,
