1)  I just talked with Scott Earnest and asked him to send you and John  Sherriff copies of the lastest draft of the report on Singapore.
This draft  now incorporates comments from Bill Bradford that were pending last week (he  made the trip to Sydney and Singapore, but had to be in New York last week,  meaning his imput was delayed until yesterday.
You and John should receive  those drafts today.
2)  I sent an e:mail message to John Sherriff after you and I talked, simply  to clarify the several purposes of my trip to London (since you said he was  asking).
I have scheduled a brief meeting one-on-one with him while I am  there.
3)  To outline for you the primary points on my agenda for the week, they are  the following:  Iron out with you the trading operations support that Brent and I can provide  for you during this transition period Finalize details with Tara Rozen on work permits, accomodations and all of  the details on having support personnel in London   Map out with you how we can provide training, orientation and contacts for  Michael Jordan when he arrives to help make his assimilation a smooth one  (which as you and I discussed, may involved a short stint in Houston)  Meet with you, Barry, Richard Sage and anyone else that you feel is  appropriate to collect their ideas on working collectively on effective  trading operations and controls world-wide  I look forward to seeing you next week.
