Anita:  It was great hearing from you and it sounds as though you have lots  going on!
I am trying to refresh myself on the type of trading activity which is  currently taking place in Singapore (physical vs. financial, types of  commodities) and the confirmation procedures (what is confirmed in Singapore  vs. what is confirmed in London).
Is there a written set of procedures that  I can see?
Should I be asking this question of Paul Simons?
anyone else?
Please send me an e-mail.
These issues are arising because of my involvement  in working with the Brazilian office.
Thanks.
Looking forward to speaking  to you soon.
Sara
