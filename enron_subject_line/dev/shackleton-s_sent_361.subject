I will not be arriving in BA this week.
Will you be available either Sept.  23 or 24?
I will be in Enron's BA office on those two days.
I can meet at  your convenience.
With respect to your comments to our ISDA Schedule, please let me know when  to expect your comments.
You previously indicated that I would receive  comments by Sept. 10.
Also, could you please fax the article.
It was apparently scanned.
We can  only open word documents and we cannot open the article which which was sent  and resent on Friday, Sept. 10.
Thanks.
