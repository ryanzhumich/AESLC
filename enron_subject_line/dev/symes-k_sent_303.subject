The EnPower IT group in Houston is making some changes to the EOL Report  which in the long run will improve its functionality, but in the interim has  left it temporarily disabled.
I have left a message for Nicolay Kraltchev,  the IT staff member in charge of the project, and he will be contacting both  Carla Hoffman and me tomorrow.
With any luck, this will be resolved by Friday  evening and we can resume distribution of the report as usual.
I'm sorry for  any inconvenience this causes.
Thanks,
