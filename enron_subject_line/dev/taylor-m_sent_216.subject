Buck:  Here's my list of things to do on the boat.
Let me know what you think we= =20 should work on first.
On Deck:  Winch maintenance (someday I=01,d like to install a self tailing halyard w= inch)  Inspect rig, adjust tension  Some system needed to prevent jib sheets chafing on shrouds  Check jib sheet cars  Brightwork refinishing Cockpit drains should be checked for adequate flow - particularly those under the engine hatch  Spreader boot needs to be reinstalled on starboard spreader  Windex needs to be straightened/tightened  Electronics:  VHF - check  Depth Sounder - not reading consistently, odd read-out  Wind Speed indicator - not registering  Knot Meter - paddle wheel needs to be installed  Loran - operating properly?
Engine gauges - check ammeter, tach  Fresh Water System:  Galley faucet not working (and sink drains very slowly)  System should be disinfected  Broken hose under sink in head  Check leaks around ports, probably rebed ports  Interior teak oiled  Stereo:  Only working on one channel  Install CD player
