I just heard from Tenley that you and Steve have been in a pretty bad car  wreck and are hospitalized in Florida.
My thoughts and prayers are with both  of you.
She said you were checking your emails so I just wanted to get a  note in to you, and when you feel better maybe we could have a little chat.
I miss you!
