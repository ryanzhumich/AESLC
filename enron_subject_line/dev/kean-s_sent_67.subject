In order to better align our resources with the business units we support,  we are designating the following individuals as operating company leads with  primary responsibility for designing and implementing government and  regulatory affairs support for the operating companies and to serve as  primary contacts for the operating companies:    EBS: Scott Bolton & Donald Lassere    EES: Harry Kingerski    ENA: Jim Steffes   In addition to supporting the operating company organizations, these  individuals will report to Rick Shapiro.
Jim Steffes will retain his  responsibilities for regulatory risk assessment and will continue to report  to Steve Kean in that capacity.
There are already numerous working relationships and points of contact  between government affairs and the operating companies.
The designation of  Scott, Donald, Harry and Jim as leads does not change that.
Rather, we are  looking to these individuals to coordinate these activities and serve as a  "go to" resource on issues which impact the respective operating companies.
