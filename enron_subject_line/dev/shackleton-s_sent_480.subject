In connection with the ISDA negotiations, PG&E is insisting on revising our  "Limitation of Liability" language"  "...PROVIDED, HOWEVER,THAT NOTHING IN THIS PROVISION SHALL AFFECT THE  ENFORCEABILITY OF SECTION 6(e) OF THIS AGREEMENT with respect to incidental  damages."
PG&E claims that it will never be responsible for consequential damages and  that certain elements of "Loss" comprise consequential damages (PG&E always  agrees to "Market Quotation").
Have you ever prepared a list of the "Loss" components?
Can you assess before I go to Haedicke (or is this a non-starter)?
Thanks.
