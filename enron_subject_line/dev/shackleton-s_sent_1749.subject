Clint:  after the meeting, Jim advised me that the ENE board resolution will  be drafted for the Oct. meeting.
In the interim, he is convinced that only  Enron Corp. should be a swap party to these equity swaps, forwards, etc.
I  am going to speak with Rod Nelson (credit) and make some changes to our  approach.
This should also make life easier negotiating with Lehman and Bear  (from a credit perspecttive) but we'll reach an obvious stalemate when they  ask for an Enron Corp. resolution (forthcoming after the relevant board  meeting.
