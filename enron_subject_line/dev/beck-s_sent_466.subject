Mary,  As Brent Price is out of the country until July & I am travelling out of the  country more frequently, I would like to temporarily designate Susan Harrison  as a signer.
Susan is the Director of our off-system Settlements & Volume  Management groups.
This temporary designation will ensure that we maintain  appropriate signing coverage while Brent & I are unavailable.
Thanks,
