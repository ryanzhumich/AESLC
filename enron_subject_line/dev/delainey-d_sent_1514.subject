By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you  with information about your role as a timekeeper.
This role is very  important at Enron.
By using a single time entry system, we will be able to  gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their  associated costs.
Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs  real-time.
If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and  project costing are negatively impacted.
We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at  3:00 p.m., CST.
It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline.
Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Yvonne Laing,  our site manager, on what you need to do before June 30th.
Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry  periods.
Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE)  at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.
We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a  success.
Sincerely,
