Dale,  On the new Gas Daily product that you are setting up, I think it would be a  good idea to have a Nymex reference in the short description.
Something  like, US Gas Daily NX GD/D HSC.
In addtion, we need two new index locations set up, Carthage hub and Agua  Dulce hub.
Please contact Todd Richardson for further details on these.
Thanks for your help.
