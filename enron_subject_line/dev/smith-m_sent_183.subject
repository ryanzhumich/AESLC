Amanda,  Can you put this file in the appropriate directory, and create the necessary  link under the "Testing" tab of the fundamentals website.
It should be  called Kern Expansion Economics".
I don't have a description yet (and I'm  still working on the other one I owe you).
Let me know if you have any  questions.
Thanks.
Mat
