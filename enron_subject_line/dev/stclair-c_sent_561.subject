Brando: We already have a Master Agreement with Swiss Re in place so I don't  understand why we would enter into another one with them to do online  trades.
Please call me to discuss.
Also, Mark Tawney and Paul Henery had  sent up for my review a form of ELRIX GA Participation Agreement which I had  sent them comments and questions on.
Is that related to this?
It would be  helpful to me if perhaps you, mark and i could meet so you could explain to  me what we are trying to accomplish.
My assistant Suzanne Adams (37340) can  help you set something up.
Carol   P.S.
The agreement that you sent to me refers to ELRIX Website Terms and  Conditions and ELRIX Weather Derivatives Privacy Policy, both of which I need  to see.
