Marie and I were just looking at the activities list for the Legal Conference  and noticed you were signed up to "relax at the resort".
Not to get you  worked up or anything, but there is a huge outlet mall just outside San  Antonio, and there would be no shortage of cheap britches to be found!
After  all, it has been a few years since you cornered the market when you were  here, and you probably need to keep up with the latest fashions.
(Not to  belabor a dead horse, but again style watchers are telling us that the  fashion for Spring and Summer for men will be knee length "pedal pushers".)
We look forward to seeing our favorite Englishman (delete this message after  viewing, we don't want the other lads to get jealous!)
