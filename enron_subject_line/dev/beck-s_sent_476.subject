I am sorry that I will not be able to join you tonight for dinner and to hear  Julie Andrews speak.
Tonight is the induction ceremony for the high school  drill team members for next year, with parents being introduced as well as  our daughters.
So the place that I most need to be tonight is at Klein High  School with Meagan.
Thanks to Mary for arranging the dinner.
I hope that all of you enjoy the  evening.
The final speaker in the series is Jane Goodall, and that will be next  Tuesday, May 16.
Please let me know if you have any suggestions for a spot  for dinner.
That night is Meagan's 16th birthday, so I have asked her to be  my guest that evening for dinnner and the lecture.
I can't think of a better  idea for this birthday than to expose her to a group of very bright,  motivated women!
I will look forward to introducing her to those of you  whom she has not yet met.
