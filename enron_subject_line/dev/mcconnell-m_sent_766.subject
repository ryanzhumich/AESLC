Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.
I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines,  personnel responsibilities and key action items.
I think this is another  good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and  assignments.
Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very  smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.
You will like him and  he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a  couple of weeks.
He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse  engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.
He has  others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his  existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper  already).
Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the  short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she  could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good  option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary  Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck  (advice and discuss additional resources).
I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick  thoughts on process and lessons learned.
I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early  versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper.
I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the  marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.
I wanted him to make sure  that he understood the importance and priority of this effort.
I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John  Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday  afternoon.
Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to  add a trading perspective?
A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.
