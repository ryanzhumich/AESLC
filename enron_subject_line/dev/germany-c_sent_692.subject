Hey Team.
Doug, correct me if I'm wrong, CES no longer has any Equitrans  market and we still have the production.
For July, take all of this gas into  CNG.
You will probably need to get the CNG meter set up in Sitara.
You  should also make sure the interconnect with CGAS is setup.
You are all wonderfull people  - I will make this free pop Friday (Wooo Hooo).
thanks
