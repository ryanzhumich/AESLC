Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of  the agreement:   How are we setting the heat rate?
Do we have the GADS (?)?
Is it a daily  average, weekly average?
Flat rate?
Adjusted?
If so, how often?
Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?
We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?
We aren't making money on gas, right?
Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to  the picture?
Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?
It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the  following, in words and/or formulae:  The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost)  formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to  work on.
Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost  of power)?
How are we setting the bogey?
Formula?
Subject to audit?
Two  bogeys or one (gas and oil)?
What is defn of profit?
I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or  two would be helpful as a reality check.
What costs are included on the buy  and sell side?
Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used.
Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits.
What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split  costs/profits?
Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?
It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these  questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.
Thanks,
