I just spoke to Frank, and spoke to Jeff Blumenthal earlier this week about  tax issues arising out of Amita executing documents on behalf of EOL and  ENA.
Frank just informed me that the Japan office has also been provided  with stamp of Sheri Thomas's signature so they can execute PA's out of  Japan.
Frank and I were thinking we might want to get together sometime next  week to discuss this.
