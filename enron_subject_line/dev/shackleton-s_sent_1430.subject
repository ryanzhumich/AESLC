Shari:  When you get back after vacation and have caught up, give me a call  to chat about the NYISO pricing.
Elizabeth suggested that we coordinate our  efforts to capture extreme pricing revisions and negative pricing issues.
Our power confirms currently include a modified version of Section 7.3 (of  the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions) in our omnibus confirms for  price changes.
I am still tracking third party paper.
Thanks.
Sara
