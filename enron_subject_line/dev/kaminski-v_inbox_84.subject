Bob,  I am writing to you to confirm my voice-mail message regarding the SEC deposition.
I decided that I don't really  need a counsel to assist me at my deposition before the Commission.
I may retain a lawyer of my own choice to give me general  advice about the procedures and I shall send you the bill for reimbursement of expenses.
My decision should not be interpreted as a statement about Mr. Levy's qualifications.
I found him to be an exceptionally competent lawyer.
My only regret is that I shall not be given an opportunity to spend more time with him and learn from his experience.
You may recall that  I have indicated to you a few weeks ago that my intention was to waive my right to a counsel.
This was before I had the pleasure to meet Mr. Levy in person.
I am sending you the copy of my fax to the SEC as an attachment to a separate message.
Vince
