Tanya: We finally got a draft of the CSA from their counsel.
Just a few questions  for you:  1.
Threshold amounts for both of us are $7,500,000.
For some reason, they  gave themselves a $15,000,000 threshold.
2.
I am assuming that we want a MAC trigger that will bring the threshold to  zero.
Is the MAC trigger for both of us below BBB-?
3.
For the issuer of an LC, they have that the rating can be either A- by S&P  or A3 by Moody's.
Do you want to insist on requiring both ratings?
4.
Is our Guaranty cap $15,000,000?
