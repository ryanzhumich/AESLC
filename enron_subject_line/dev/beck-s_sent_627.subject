Two of you had to leave the staff meeting before this final discussion point  and three of you were not in attendance, so I wanted to send you the attached  memo that I distributed at the end of the meeting.
This memo will be sent by  Rick Causey via notes mail regarding an additional role that I will assume  with regard to global operations.
I shared this in the staff meeting so that  you would be the first to know.
I will still fulfill my role within ENA as  VP of Energy Operations.
I will not be going away!
This expanded  responsibility should create addtional opportunities for operations personnel  and will validate some of the global functions that we already provide to the  organization.
