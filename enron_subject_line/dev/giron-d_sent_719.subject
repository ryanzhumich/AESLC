Sean,  How's CO?
I hope you are doing well.
I know I have asked you before, but I  seem to have accidentally deleted your dad and sister's email addresses.
I  want to ask you dad if he will be in town when KU plays Texas later in  November.
I want to bring the whole family.
If you get a chance, shoot me a  message with his info.
My mom is vacationing in NY so I can't ask her.
Thanks.
