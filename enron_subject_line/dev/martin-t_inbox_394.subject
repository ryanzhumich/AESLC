Anne  I left the following in your office this morning:  1) Correspondence and Gregg Modeling inovice totalling $107,635.
We feel that this is an issue that AEP needs to settle directly with Gregg Engineering.
2) D.L.
Peterson Trust invoice totalling $22,152 for a truck.
AEP has paid the invoice dated 5/24/01 and asked us for reimbursement.
However we see this as a non-emergency purchase right before close that was not properly authorized by Brian.
Also attached is an updated Inventory and Working Capital Calculation Statement.
I have updated based on the change in the prime rate yesterday.
Call me at 3-5346 if you need anything else.
Jim
