Good afternoon,  Our son Michael will be in your class beginning next Monday, October 2, so I  wanted to introduce myself.
I hope we will get to meet in person soon.
Is there anything you would like to suggest that we do to make the transition  easier?
I picked up the package of information today, and will read it tonight.
l  won't ask any questions until I do my homework.
I look forward to seeing you soon!
Kay
