Organization Announcement (Correction)   I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.
I had indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not correct.
Ken will be supporting  OEC.
Corrected announcement is provided below.
It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. EH&S Asset Operations.
He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.
Ken has over 25 year experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas industry.
He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive international experience.
We are excited to have Ken in our team so, please welcome Ken in his new role.
Henry  Van
