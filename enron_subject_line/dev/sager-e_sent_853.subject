At 10:45 am today, Jan 6th, we sent a notice to TVA advising them that a  Triggering Event under the MOPA had occurred.
As a result of the Triggering  Event, EPMI has the right to suspend deliveries and/or to terminate the  MOPA.
At this point, we have not elected to suspend deliveries or to  terminate the MOPA.
Accordingly, our performance under the MOPA at this  point will not be impacted and we will continue to perform under the terms of  the MOPA.
The letter also sets forth a proposal to TVA pursuant to which EPMI would be  willing to continue performing under the MOPA.
This proposal is conditioned  on  TVA allowing EPMI to seek a judicial determination of its rights and  TVA  paying market-based rates for the energy delivered by EPMI to TVA under the  MOPA  pending the judicial proceedings.
If you have any questions, please call me at 36349.
