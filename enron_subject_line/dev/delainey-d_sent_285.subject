Randy, Scott Healy contacted Bob Kelly at Calpine about Calpine's potential  interest in Bridgeline and he found that Kelly and Cartwright had no real  knowledge of the potential deal.
Likely this originates at the local level  and is probably a long put.
Kelly was going to get back to Scott with more  detail over the next week.
