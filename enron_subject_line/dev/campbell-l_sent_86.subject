John, this is a short note to let you know where we stand on the  7 mile  pipeline construction Rogas Project with respect to environmental  permitting  and approvals.
The following documents and applications have been submitted to the agencies:   California fish and game 1603 application   Kern County Floodplain Management Agency-encroachment application   US COE 404 Nationwide permit- preconstruction notification   Reclamation Board- encroachment application   Califonia State Fire Marshall-waiver to install aboveground pipeline   Office of Pipeline Safety-waiver to Install aboveground pipeline  I am checking to see what state requirements there are for SHPO clearances  for this project.
I would suspect that they would  want us to do a field  survey prior to construction.
It seems that every Califonia state and county  agency is a candidate for notification or approval.
Ill keep you  apprised......
