Yes...I am a true Longhorn.
I think that's why I like Steak Night so much.
I mean how can you beat sitting on a deck, drinking a beer and solving the  words problems (OK., 2 out of 3 ain't bad).
Anyway, Wednesday night sounds  good to me, although, given how work has been going lately I doubt I'll be  able to get there before 7:30.
Just do me a favour and forewarn Pat that  Emily may be attending so he can prepare properly (I don't want any  bloodshed).
I think a couple co-workers are also planning on coming so it  should a good group.
