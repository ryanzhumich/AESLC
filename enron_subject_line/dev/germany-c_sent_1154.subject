I will be emailing all of you with any capacity issues I find.
CGLF k#64502 ;  This is an offshore FTS2 contract that we use with the West  Cam Devon production.
The demand charge is $1.4381 on a volume of 29,000 dts  and the commodity is $.0024.
According to my notes; this is a volumetric  demand contract and the volumetric demand charge in my sheet is $.0648  I am changing this to a regular demand charge contract in Sitara and the  worksheet.
