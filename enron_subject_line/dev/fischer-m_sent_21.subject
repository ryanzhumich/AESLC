Jeff,  Mar - May 2002 have been recalculated and spreadsheets created.
Mar & Apr  wend down slightly due to the "extra" turbines.
May has gone up, possibly due  to some data filling in holes from before, data recovery does appear to be  better this time.
The spreadsheets are sorted and totaled by Bus.ID.
The  "extras" are at the bottom with 0 production.
