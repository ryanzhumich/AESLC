Does Vanessa know anything about this?
I know that we had a definite  interest several years ago in a system from Siebel.
We shelved it at the  time due to IT resource constraints and Philippe's concern over costs.
In  the meantime, EES bought a license and uses this system.
I know that Mary  was resurrecting this with someone on her team.
She had recently reviewed it  with Brenda Herod, I believe.
This is one of the items that we listed in  Dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for  others.
