Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var,  p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves  before submitting their data to Houston.
I am also told that it is really not  necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of  business London.
Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it  would be better than what we have now.
This would greatly improve the  efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management.
Can you guys  initiate this change or get me to the right person there.
Thanks, Rick
