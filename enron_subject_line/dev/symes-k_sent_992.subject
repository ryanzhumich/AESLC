Kim -  I've finished changing the list of deals you faxed over to no confirm.
Please  let me know if you continue to see these deals on your new deal report.
I  still had questions on some of the Short Term and Long Term Northwest deals.
On those I will defer to Diana Scholtes.
I also have questions on the  following deals:  557772 - why are we not confirming a daily with Pacificorp?
552516 - why are we not confirming a daily with Riverside?
And there were two deals I couldn't for the life of me read on that fax, so  you may still see deals showing up that don't necessarily need to be  confirmed.
Diana -  I know we had decided not to confirm deals done with Portland General  Electric, but before I change the following deals to "no confirm" I want to  clarify under what conditions we do not confirm with this counterparty.
1.
If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is elsewhere (Mid-C,  Montana System, etc.
), do we confirm?
2.
If the counterparty is something other than PGE and the delivery point is  Portland General System, do we confirm?
3.
If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is Portland General  System, do we confirm?
I apologize for asking so many questions, but I've got a long list of deals  in front of me and before I create an irreparable mess I wanted to check that  I'm doing this right.
Please let me know.
