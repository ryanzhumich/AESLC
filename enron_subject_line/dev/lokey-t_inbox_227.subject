Last month all of your donations helped Enron raise a grand total of $6 million for the United Way, including our corporate match.
Once again Enron employees made a difference and contributed more than any other pacesetter company in Houston.
Also, congratulations to Elaine Brown with Enron Global Markets who won the drawing for two round-trip airline tickets for participating in this year's campaign.
Thanks to everyone at Enron for your generosity!
This week Enron and the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast have entered in to yet another exciting partnership.
Beginning with the Astros vs Giants game on Tuesday, October 2, one of Enron's primary signs at Enron Field will feature the United Way logo alongside the Enron logo.
The decision to include United Way's logo on the sign marks the first time in history that a naming rights partner is sharing exposure on one of its primary in-stadium signage locations with a non-profit partner.
This sign is also a free, innovative way to demonstrate Enron's support of the United Way and promote the agency's role in our community.
The millions of fans who attend Astros games each season will see the sign.
Be sure to look for this history-making sign hanging high above the outfield.
