Following up on our conversation re: a visit to Santa Fe when you come to  Houston, check out the Website for The Bishop's Lodge in Santa Fe  (www.bishopslodge.com).
Some friends of mine bought a weekend there at a  silent auction at a charity event recently and their brochure looked great.
The website has pictures, prices, activities at the resort, and a hyperlink  to the Website for the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce which lists the  activities going on in Santa Fe.
I think you are going to be too late for  their summer opera series, but I took a look and there appears to be other  fun things going on.
The website for the lodge shows a fabulous looking  pool, horseback riding and shooting.
Take a look.
