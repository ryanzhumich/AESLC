Parties represented at an informal meeting after the February 7, 2000  prehearing conference discussed circulating redlined versions of the CAC  settlement proposal as a point of departure for further settlement  conferences.
Transwestern Pipeline Company submits the following comments in  lieu of a redlined document.
Transwestern fully supports the CAC's proposal of a path-defined receipt  point structure that would define primary and secondary rights at receipt  points on the SoCalGas system.
Not only does the proposal satisfy the  Commission's requirement that Hector Road be established as a formal receipt  point, it is also consistent with open and non-discriminatory access and use  of the SoCalGas system, and will help provide a reasonable degree of  certainty so that all market participants can more effectively plan gas  transportation.
CAC's proposed receipt point principles ensure that no  upstream transportation provider will unduly be denied access to SoCal's  system.
Transwestern believes that the parties may still need to address certain  details regarding implementation of the receipt point proposal that have not  been fully described in the CAC document.
To this end, Transwestern proposes  that implementation of the receipt point proposal be included on the agenda  for the upcoming all-party settlement discussions.
Transwestern looks  forward to a constructive discussion of the proposal and is confident that  the parties will be able to agree on a plan for implementation.
