Attached is a summary of the conference call held between Enron, Citizens, and PP&L on October 18th.
Proposed procedures on how we will handle cuts from now on are also included.
Enron is making every effort available to ensure that PP&L receives 100% of the gas that they call on.
I feel that we need to formally agree to these procedures, either in the form of an amendment to the agreement or a formal letter signed by all parties.
Please let me know if you have any comments regarding these procedures and how you would like to proceed.
Thanks,
