Phillip;  Could you please e-mail me the draw file you created for Bishops Corner.
I was working on submitting it to you and rather then recreate it I should just have you send it back to me to fill in the new draw totals.
Also, I need the vendor payee list that you created for the Land and Soft costs.
I need to re-format it by draw number and to the Bank One format, and again it would be easier to get it from you then to re-create it.
Please take a look at the following summary and compare to your numbers to see if you agree.
Land And Soft Costs 	- 	Initial Draw	$	  1,608,683.05 					Galaxy			-	Draw # 1	$	     250,000.00 					Galaxy			-	Draw # 2	$	     223,259.09  						Total Paid To Date Cash		$	  2,081,942.14  					Project Cost					$	10,740,980.87 					Loan Amount					$	  8,055,736.65  					Equity Required				$	  2,685,244.22 					Developer Profit					$	 (   326,202.57)  						Balance Of Funding			$	  2,359,041.65  						Total Paid To Date			$	  2,081,942.14  						Balance To Fund Cash			$	     277,099.51   					Galaxy			-	Draw # 3	$	     467,566.66  						Bank One Draw # 1			$	     190,467.15 						Final Cash Funding			$	     277,099.51   I think you thought you had more to fund.
However, I do not see that you accounted for the cash portion of the Developer fee that you paid CIS.
Am I looking at this right?
Please let me know and attach?
the files discussed above.
I am working all day Monday so I hope I can get it before then if possible.
Thanks A Lot
