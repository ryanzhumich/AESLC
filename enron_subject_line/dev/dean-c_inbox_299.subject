Group,  For those on night and day shift on Saturday/Sunday the emergency back-up generators will be tested.
The testing will occur from 5 AM to 10 AM on Sunday morning.
Dave Steiner has assured me that RT will be unaffected and Dave will be on hand to help if anything is needed.
I think we should work to have everything submitted early to the CISO, tags made, etc.
At least for HE 6, HE 7 and HE 8.
This should give us some extra time if something goes wrong when they switch to the back-up power.
Bill
