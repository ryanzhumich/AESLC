Kathryn Corbally (Senior Director currently in Investor Relations) is moving  to Connecticut soon to join her husband.
He has been working up there for  the last six or eight months - he was one of the group that defected from our  weather derivatives team about a year ago.
She hopes to continue to work for  Enron - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I  can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in Enron's New York  office.
It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn  could be someone for you to consider.
She came originally from the London  office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some  feedback on her.
In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very  early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting.
She came to  Houston and  has done a number of different things.
I think that she is well  organized and control minded.
Understands Enron's business.
Managing a  group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.
I am not sure that  people enjoy working under her.
That could be old news, however.
There are  a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her  based on very recent experience.
Do you know of her?
Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York.
Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there.
She would  definitely represent an Enron point of view.
They have two small daughters -  she might be interested in something part time even.
Could mean lower cost  that way.
This idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals.
If you do want to consider this, I will be glad to help identify who you  could go to for some fact finding around her.
Let me know.
