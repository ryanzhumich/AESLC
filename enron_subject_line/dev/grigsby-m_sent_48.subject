I made some big changes to the index curves tonight.
Please run a new P&L  early in the morning in order to estimate what the changes in book value will  be.
I will need to let John Lavorado know about the changes to the curves  before we decide to book these tomorrow.
Please run a report from the  transport model so that I may see the changes to the delivery points.
Thanks,
