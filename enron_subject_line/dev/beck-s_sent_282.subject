On Sunday, the new Fortune magazine was a roadway for my two-year old's  cars.
On Monday, my sixteen year-old used the cover to cut out pictures of  money for a school project.
Last night, the magazine made it into my hands  around midnight when everything at home was settled in for the night.
What a  nice article!
I smiled while reading it.
How nice to see your  accomplishments recognized in print.
Congratulations.
I hope that you have  plenty of copies for your mom and dad.
