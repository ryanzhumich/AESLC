Hello Marie, per our conversation this morning, please find attached Coastal States Trading, Inc.'s standard schedules, along with a copy of our guaranty format.
We prefer to make proposed changes directly on the electronic version(as opposed to hard copy).
Please red-line the schedule on the PC, put a draft date in the upper right hand corner of the first page of both schedules, then email the schedules back to John Shuttee for review.
John will handle all negotiations for this ISDA.
He can be reached at 713/420-3548 or john.shuttee@elpaso.com.
Thanks for attention to this matter.
