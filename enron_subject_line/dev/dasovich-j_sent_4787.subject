To add to Bev's comments, I've gotten many calls from large customers today.
I'll be meeting with them in Sacramento on Monday to discuss the core/noncore  structure further and try to craft a core/noncore structure that makes  sense.
I've also asked Sandi and the Sacramento team to line up meetings  with key legislators while I'm there to discuss the same.
Business is, as was expected, very unhappy about that portion of the plan  that would stick them with all of Edison's debts.
They view it as unfair and  punitive (which it is) and are frustrated that the Democrats would include it  simply to "make the deal Harvey proof."
Many questioned Keeley about why the  Democrats are hell bent on pandering to Harvey.
Keely said that the Assembly  is also trying to come up with something that will get support from the  Senate (read "Burton").
Keely also mentioned our name in a list of many names as sources of  information used to build the proposal.
Best,
