Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.
Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.
The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.
However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.
I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.
