Guys, Wes is going to come talk to you about booking more value in Mariner in  order to meet Global Finance and ENA targets.
I want a view from you guys of  what is the prudent carry value for Mariner assuming current gas prices and  the reserve increases assumed to coming.
Keep in mind what would be a  reasonble sale value for the asset mid-next year as per our plan.
Regards
