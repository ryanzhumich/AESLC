Mark and Sara: David Runnells has come up with a lawyer from A&K to help us out.
His name  is Jason Peters and he is coming over at 3:30 on Monday to meet with us.
Shonnie and Peter D. have worked with him and Shonnie left me a voice mail  telling me that he was very good.
Haven't heard from Peter yet.
