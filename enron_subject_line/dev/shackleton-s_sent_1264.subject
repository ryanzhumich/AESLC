Hey, Sam:  Great to hear from you and I'm thrilled that your golf game is as  good as ever.
Have you been playing in Palm Springs or Amelia Island or  The  Boulders?
I was in Phoenix last year and thought it was wonderful except for  the fact that people age faster.
I didn't go to Baton Rouge for Passover  since the seders were in the middle of the week.
But I know that my sister  ordered everything from the Second Avenue Deli in N.Y. and various other  Manhattan establishments.
My niece has been accepted at that high school in  Natchitoches for smart kids and Deb is really happy (and sad).
Jennifer is  only 15.
My nephew is tall, handsome and driving Steve crazy.
My parents  are fine and my Dad is going to have a knee-cap replacement sometime soon.
He'll be 83 in June.
I've decided on in-house training for my dogs and the  trainer thinks that CHLOE needs the most "help" since that sweet little  bichon may try to bite strangers (and maybe friends!)
in my home.
Otherwise,  I'm rocking along.
You know, I never called Helen but I still have her  number and I'll do it this week.
Hope all is well.
Do you keep up with  Ron?
Love, Sara
