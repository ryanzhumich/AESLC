Clem:  I gave y;our phone number to Steven Kessler who is the lawyer for  Deutsche Bank ("DB") (in New York).
You may recall that you and I spoke  earlier about DB's insistence of NO WAITING period to call upon the guarantor  (we reduced to two days).
Please call Steve  (212-469-8202) unless he calls  you first.
Thanks.
Sara
