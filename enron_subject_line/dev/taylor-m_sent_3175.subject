In case the Four Seasons doesn't work out, there are two other hotels  downtown you might consider:  The Stephen F. Austin (an Intercontinental I  think) and the Driskill.
Both are old (by U.S. standards) hotels that have  been updated.
For several years after its renovation the Driskill was the  nicest place in town - then came the Four Seasons.
The Stephen F. Austin was  just completely redone a year or so ago - I haven't been inside but I hear  they did a nice job.
Both are primarily business hotels so they may have  good weekend rates.
