For online trading I am also going to have to sign off on whether we can  trade with the UK based counterparty list, and I am probably going to need  your help and your list to be able to do that.
I am totally unfamiliar with  the UK based counterparties and in most cases their names aren't even in  English so I can't even guess whether it would be an appropriate counterparty  or not.
I am, obviously, most concerned about not approving trading with  utilities and governmentals.
I've been searching that utility website trying  to figure out which are utilities from that, and guessing at the names if it  sounds like a utility or governmental.
Is your list done, or when will it be done?
Do you spell out if the  counterparty is governmental/utility?
What help can you give me?
