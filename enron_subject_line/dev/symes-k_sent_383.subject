How goes it, girlfriend?
I just got your message - sorry I haven't been in  touch yet, and I can give you all the excuses in the book about how I've been  swamped with work, play, life in general, but we both know I'm just flaky, so  there's no point in explaining it.
Anyway, I'm so excited to hear you're doing well in your new Rocky Mountain  dwelling, but you left me here with no good pissing and moaning (and getting  "pissed") buddies.
So I checked out airfares to Denver, and found one for  $118 roundtrip!
Can you freakin' believe it?
Anyway, you have to purchase and  use the ticket by the end of March, so I was thinking a little spring break  action was called for.
Do you think you'd be settled enough by the end of  March to accomodate a portly older sister for a few days?
Let me know, and  I'll do the deal.
Got to go - business abounds at Enron as usual.
I'll try to drop you a line  tonight when I have more time to write.
Do you have a phone number?
Amber was  in Denver over the weekend, and she and Monica called me trying to get ahold  of you, but I had no idea where to look.
(Except somewhere in Denver, but  from what I've heard it's a fairly big place.)
Write back soon, or call - I want to know how the internship is.
But more  importantly, how's the unlimited Starbucks coffee?
Love,
