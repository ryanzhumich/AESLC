This is a short note to apprise those that the before and after emissions  testing for the fuel valves and carbuerator at  the Spraberry C/S has been  submitted to  t he TNRCC.
The data showed fuel savings, as we had hoped it would and we  also received an emissions reduction benefit.
According to the agency, this  replacement activity will not require an amendment to the permit, which will  be a plus for the company.
My compliments to all involved for the retesting and efforts it took to make  this happen.
I will forward the response from the TNRCC as it is received.
