Anna:  I propose the following for Schedule B:  "The fourth sentence of Paragraph 10 of the Securities Loan Agreement is  amended to read as follows:  In the event that (i) the purchase price of Replacement Securities (plus all  other amounts, if any, due to Lender hereunder) exceeds (ii) the amount of  the Collateral, Borrower shall be liable to Lender for the amount of such  excess together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the rate per annum  equal to the cost (without proof or evidence of any actual cost) to the  Lender (as certified by it) if it were to fund or of funding the relevant  amount plus 1% per annum, as such rate fluctuates from day to day, from the  date of such purchase until the date of payment of such excess."
Clement Abrams is on vacation this week.
I'll call soon.
