Marcello:  By way of introduction, I am a lawyer with Enron North America Corp.("ENA")  in the derivatives area.
I have read your memorandum of March 17, 1997 which  was prepared for us and which addressed both physical and financial trading  issues.
I am also aware of the recent memo which you prepared for Brent Hendry re:   internet trading.
I have two (2) followup questions for you limited specifically to financial  trading (NOT VIA INTERNET):   (1)  Do you have any changes to add to your memo of March 17, 1997 with  respect to financial trading?
(2)  Would you modify ENA's Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement (which I  believe Brent Hendry recently forwarded to your attention)?
I look forward to hearing from you.
ENA is about to execute a trade with a  Chilean corporate and I will most likely see the trade confirmation in the  next day or so.
You can reach me via email or by phone at (713) 853-5620.
Thank you very much.
