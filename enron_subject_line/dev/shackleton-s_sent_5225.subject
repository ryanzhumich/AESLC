Sharen:  In connection with the two (2) swap confirmations which you are revising  (from a "Deemed ISDA" format to a regular ISDA format), I ask that you please  contact  Stephanie to review the final forms.
Please note the following:  (1)  Melissa's prior "Deemed ISDA" drafts (dated Nov. 22, 2000) show ENA swap  nos.
as 447459.4 and 447459.02.
One of your confims doesn't match:  it says  447459.04.
Please verify the correct number.
(2)  You can eliminate the "Payment Date(s)" section from the General Terms  because individual Payment Dates appear in both the Fixed and Floating  Details.
After either Tana or Stephanie have approved, please email to EWEB as follows  (with a copy to Holli Krebs):  jdeason@chbh.com Dick.Varner@eweb.eugene.or.us  NOTE TO STEPHANIE:  copies of my markups  and the Deemed ISDA's are located  in a file entitled "EWEB confirmations".
Also, the ISDA has not been signed  but will be dated October 30, 2000.
