Sally did not realize that the recommendations as drafted had referred to the  master agreement process at all.
She indicated that if she had noticed that  she would have deleted the reference and will revise the recommendations to  that effect now.
The net result is that the only change regarding financial  trading documentation will be to designate someone on the confirmation desk  in Calgary to handle derivatives confirmations.
Jeff Sorensen will  coordinate with Peggy Hedstrom.
