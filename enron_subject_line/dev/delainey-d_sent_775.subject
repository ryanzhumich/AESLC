These are the reviews that I have completed or nearing completion:  - Dave Duran  - Joe Deffner  - Tammy Sheppherd  - Scott Josey  - Brian Redmond  - Rob Milnthorp  - Janet Dietrich  - Chris Calger  - John Thompson  - Max Yzaguirre  - Jeff Donahue  - Wes Colwell  - Kay Chapman  David, Greg told me that you were going to create a master list of  reviews/reviewers to be completed to ensure that the Wholesale OOC's catches  all commercial and non-commercial direct reports.
I would suggest that we  follow up with a master list for each business unit to ensure that all  reviews are completed across ENA much like the process we undertook at  mid-year.
I would shoot for 100% participation target.
How are we making  out on the NIM/Issues folks in ENA - either out the door or completed plans?
Regards
