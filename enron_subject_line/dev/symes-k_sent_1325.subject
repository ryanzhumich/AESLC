To re-cap:  I've changed three Short Term West Hourly deals to reflect what all parties  have agreed to - EPMI sells to Sierra Pacific Holding Co., HE 23-24 on 4/28,  HE 1-24 on 4/29, and HE 1-6 on 4/30.
Instead of selling to the Automated  Power Exchange, we'll be using them as the broker, paying a $.03 per MW fee,  and selling to Sierra Pacific.
Following are the changed deal numbers, for  reference:  595705 595714 595819  I believe this should clear up any discrepancies we had among different  counterparties' invoices.
Now all we have to do is cross our fingers....no,  just kidding.
Please let me know if you have questions, or if problems arise  from these changes.
Thank you,
