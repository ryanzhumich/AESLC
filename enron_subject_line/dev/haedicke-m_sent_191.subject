Great conference in Amsterdam.
It was the best one yet.
I would like to  have an IDSA sponsored energy conference in Houston sometime in the next  year.
I think the time will be ripe to focus on (a)  energy derivatives  around the world and (b) the application of web technology to energy.
If we  do it right, we may draw a large group internationally and build our  membership dramatically.
Let me know what you think.
