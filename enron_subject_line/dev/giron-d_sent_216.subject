How goes it?
I wanted to check in with you and make sure we are still on for  March.
I also need to let you know we will have an extra person besides the  four of us.
He is the kid of some people who are driving up and is flying  with us.
I hope this is OK.
He can acutally babysit so maybe we can go out  one night.
Let me know.
Also,  I just hired a KU kid just out of undergrad  school.
He's pretty bummed out about Baylor.
Talk to you soon.
