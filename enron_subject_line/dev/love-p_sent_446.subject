FYI -  wanted to let you guys know about a few things: 1.
There is a central desk vacation calendar on my desk by the sun machine -  it is a little black date book.
Please put any future requests in there so  that we can keep track of who needs off when.
I would like to try and keep  from having more than 3 people out at a time.
2.
Physical gas daily options - when booking these, please be very careful.
These need to have daily swaps on them in sitara as opposed to monthly  swaps.
This will insure that the physical deal comes to the physical trader  at gas daily as opposed to mid.
This is very important to avoid OA variances.
3.
When booking deals in sitara, please look at your swaps when they are  created to verify that they are coming at the right mid/gd price.
This is  important because we have so many deals that are booked to new mids and I  notice last night on a gd option, that the swap did not come at the correct  gd curve.
4.
I am going to set up a mtg.
for friday or monday to discuss OA, the  process and how to prepare forms.
5.
Please take advantage of time that you can spend with your traders.
All  the traders have expressed their approval for each of their book admins to  spend a morning watching them trade to better understand why they take the  positions that they do.
The only request I have had is that we sit there  quietly and observe and ask questions after trading.
Please utilize this  opportunity to build a relationship with your traders - this is good for  career development.
6.
I will try and set up individual meetings with each of you to go over your  training plans.
Please shout with any questions.
PL
