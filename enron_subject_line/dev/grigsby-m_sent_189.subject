Hello.
The west gas desk would like to send a mailout to our EOL customers  regarding the new opportunity to trade "odd lots" on every physical product.
EOL has been instrumental in providing liquidity to previously illiquid  physical delivery points in the west for standard volumes of 5000 mmbtu/d and  greater, but we would like to notify our customers that EOL will now  accommodate odd size lots, in 1 mmbtu increments.
This will allow us to  trade the "non-standard" volumes with all of the market.
Do we have a creative team that might be able to assist us in our efforts?
We were thinking about a one page mailout with a clear message.
We would  like it to be very upbeat and funny.
Thank you for your assistance.
I can be reached at x37031.
Sincerely,
