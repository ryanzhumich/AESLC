from the President's Office   Issue 6, December 11, 2001  As we enter into finals week here at Monmouth College, it is yet another reminder that the Holiday season is already upon us.
We have had an excellent first semester, and we look forward to continued hard work and good fortune.
I hope that 2002 is a year of health and happiness for you and those dear to you.
*	The Monmouth choirs under the direction of Dr. Perry White, recently held their Christmas concert, entitled "Christmas at Monmouth: Come, Hurry and Run."
It was extremely well attended and beautifully done.
This concert has become a part of the Holiday festivities and traditions in the Monmouth community.
*	This past Sunday, Sandy and I held the annual President's Reception for the Monmouth community in the Morgan Room of Poling Hall.
A wonderful time to share Holiday joy with local citizens!
*	Last Friday after work, faculty and staff gathered for the President's Christmas Party.
This annual event was held at the Monmouth Country Club, and Mike Olson, who will be retiring at the end of this semester, was honored by his department chairman, Dr. Terry Glasgow.
*	Over the past several weeks numerous research presentations have been conducted by students in the Honors Program as part of their culminating experience.
*	This semester marked the initiation of pedagogy sessions for the faculty.
The first topic was "Effective Use of Questions"; the second topic was "The Effective Use of Instructional Technology in the Classroom."
*	A newly initiated colloquium series, sponsored by Dean Arnold and Dr. Fasano of the Physics department, was held on Friday afternoons this semester.
This series included presentations by faculty dealing with their research and teaching interests, as well as their scholarly activities.
*	The curriculum review, under the direction of Dean Arnold, continues to move forward.
Monthly reports on the groups' activities have been sent to you via email or regular mail.
*	The play entitled, "The Visit," was performed to full houses this fall by our Theater Department.
This was the last play directed by Dr. James DeYoung, who will be retiring at the end of this academic year.
*	The Woodrow Wilson Scholar this fall was the former ambassador to Norway, Thomas Loftus, who spent a week with students and faculty discussing important national and international political events.
*	It was a great fall for Monmouth College athletics.
The football team completed a turn-around by going 8 and 2 under second year coach, Steve Bell, who was named Midwest Conference Football Coach of the Year.
Thirteen Fighting Scots' football players were named to the All-Midwest Conference team.
*	For the first time in the College's history, our men's soccer team, under Coach Rue Carthew who was named Midwest Conference Soccer Coach of the Year, won the conference championship and advanced to NCAA National Tournament play.
Senior goalie Joel Cowan was named conference player of the year.
The Fighting Scots Soccer Team was eventually defeated by Luther College of Iowa in NCAA play.
*	This past Saturday marked the first of three academic scholarship competition days held on campus.
Typically, this is the smallest of the three days because of its proximity to Christmas, but the number of scholars on campus, compared to last year's first program, increased from 15 to 22.
*	Admission numbers are soaring at this early date.
As of December 8th, we had 799 applications, which compared very favorably to the four previous years, which were 539, 579, 543 and 583.
*	We continue to work with an admissions consultant who is helping our staff implement a prospect management and inquiry grading system.
The staff is also preparing to enhance publications and communications flow for the 2003 recruitment year.
*	Board member David Byrnes, Chairman of the Admissions Committee of the Board, recently participated in a two-day retreat with the staff and our consultant.
Dave's input and insights will be very helpful to us as we move forward.
*	The College has received a revised proposal to enhance our marketing efforts from George Dehne and Associates.
Several Board members and several vice presidents joined me for a meeting with Dehne in Chicago in November.
*	Our new Director of Intercultural Life has completed an overseas recruitment trip to several countries in the southern part of Africa and strong interest has resulted.
She also attended four specific international/minority college fairs and is organizing current international and minority students to assist in recruitment by making phone calls, writing letters, etc.
*	The City Zoning Board recently approved the development plan for the northwest corner of campus.
This will include the construction of six new tennis courts, two football practice fields, and a parking lot for 150 cars.
Campus fencing, signage and lighting are also included in the plan, which should be completed this summer.
*	College administrators will seek permission to close North Seventh Street when they meet with the Zoning Board in January.
This will be necessary in order to begin construction on the Huff Center.
*	The College continues to plan for the renovation and remodeling of the College Chapel/Auditorium.
If all progresses according to schedule, work will begin within the next several months.
*	Construction on the top floor of  Hewes Library is nearing completion and should be ready when students return in January.
Work on the lower two levels will then begin, with completion of the entire library project scheduled for Homecoming 2002.
*	The silent phase of the capital campaign continues to progress well ahead of schedule.
Approximately 85% of Board members have made pledges, and many of the remaining 15% are considering proposals.
*	This Thursday, Red Poling and I will be visiting with officers of the Kresge Foundation in Troy, Michigan to present a proposal for support of the capital campaign.
*	Thanks to the Green Army and the College Relations staff, the campus is beautifully decorated for the Holiday season.
Weather remains unseasonably warm, but very few are complaining.
Sandy and I wish you all a very Happy Holiday Season, and we again thank you
