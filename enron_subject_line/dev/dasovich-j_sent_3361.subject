Greetings Sally: My name is Jeff Dasovich.
The Greens have been helping me develop 40 acres  of land that I bought just north of Anchor Bay (a couple of miles up the hill  from Highway One, about 1200 ft or so up) and they suggested that I contact  you.
The property is right in the heart of the Banana Belt and my property faces  south, is protected, and a such is very hot and sunny from late spring  through later summer/early fall.
The property has an abundance of water on  it.
Of course, the possibility of evening fog raises some tricky issues, and  I haven't done soil tests.
In short, while I think there are some  challenges, I'm convinced that there is at least the strong possibility that  I could grow grapes--around 10 acres or so.
