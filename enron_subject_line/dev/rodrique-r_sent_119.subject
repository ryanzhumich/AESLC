Hey,  Everyone's asked me how the happy hour was last night.
What a joke.
Apparently everyone left about 9:00.
And here's the best part...Brad (new  guy) was walking up as everyone was leaving.
Wasn't it nice of him to call  and tell us that everyone was gone?
Or at least telling the bozos leaving  that I was planning on coming so that someone would have called?
I told Jeff  he owes me a Happy Hour b/c that definitely didn't count.
He said we'd have  to do a Happy Hour that was for Susan and me.
I told him I wanted my Happy  hour on the beach in Cancun.
I searched the internet for flights and sent  him an email with the flight information.
Talk to ya later, Robin  PS  Have you decided where we're going for lunch?
