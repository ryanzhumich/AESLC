Around midnight last night as I was creating our calendar for the week, I ran  through the incoming calls on caller ID to find the piano teacher's number.
I think that I saw yours.
Did I miss you sometime this weekend?
With almost  two teenagers in the house, my personal messages have dropped very far down  the list in importance.
I an never quite sure that I get messages that  anyone calls!
Feel free to call me at work, or I can try to catch you during  my commute tonight again.
Hope you had a good weekend.
Ours involved homework, shoe shopping and  continuing the search for new clothes.
Our friend Mo was in town from London  and had burgers with us on Saturday night.
