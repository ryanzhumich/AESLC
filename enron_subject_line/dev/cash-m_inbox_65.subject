Michelle,  The Coal group has a question related to personnel they would acquire from Vulcan if they purchased the marketing rights to their coal.
In this scenario, there are 4 marketing employees which would come to Enron as a part of the deal.
A few things:  In this case, I'm assuming these employees would resign from Vulcan and Enron would extend the appropriate offer.
Secondly, Enron's purchase of the marketing rights will be for an 18mo to 3 year trial period.
At the end of the trial period, if Enron returns the marketing rights to Vulcan (or current owner), they want the right to re-call these employees.
George McClellan is ok with the right to recall, but I am not sure how/where to put this in writing ie; in the deal agreement, offer letter, etc.
Thanks,
