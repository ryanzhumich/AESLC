Received a call today from Russ Boone with Duke out of Salt Lake City.
He was inquiring as to the cost of an interconnect and approximately 2 miles of pipe for Phase 1 - 105 mmbtu, and Phase 2 - 210 mmbtu.
He said he felt confident that 10" pipe could be used and asked if I could provide him with a ball park number on cost for Phase 1.
If I understood him correctly the location of the interconnect will be somewhere between West Texas and Roswell...
I didn't really get to much detail as I informed him that I would get in contact with someone that could provide him with the info requested.
He asked that if at all possible someone get back with him today.
