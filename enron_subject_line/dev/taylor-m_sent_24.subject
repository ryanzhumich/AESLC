I know you are getting the legal bills paid through Don's budget for work  done in Argentina.
Is it possible to handle the bills for work done in  Brazil the same way?
I have a bill from Tozzini that we need to pay.
Since  it is all in connection with South American trading it seems reasonable to  treat it the same as the others but I'm not sure how you are handling these  things.
Any thoughts?
