Please join the power group for a holiday celebration with good friends, good food and lots of wine!
Friday, December 28  5:00 - 8:00 pm 1432 Vassar  Please bring your families, a bottle of wine or champagne, and a dish of your choice.
I will serve a honey baked ham.
Please let me know what you would like to bring so that I can make sure that we don't end up with 8 dozen brownies or 6 pecan pies and no salad or appetizers!
