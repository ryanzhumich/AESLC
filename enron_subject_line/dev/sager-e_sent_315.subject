FYI - Here are copies of the final documents for the PGET/Avista transaction  that are being sent out for signature tonight.
Thanks for everybody's help  in getting this done.
I will be out tomorrow but can be reached at home 713  853 6349 or on my cell phone 713 854 5747 and will be checking messages.
Travis and Tracy will assist in gathering all the fax signatures and refaxing  to all parties.
Remember - EPMI is required to wire the payment to PGET ($115,714.50) and WE  NEED TO GET WIRE INFORMATION FROM PGET.
Also PGET must release cash  collateral to Avista - we should follow up to make sure this happens.
Thanks again.
