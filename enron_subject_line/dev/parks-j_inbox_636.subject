I am changing the following deal tickets in Sitara for March 2002.
I'm still not sure what to do about all the volumes showing up in Sitara for non-active deals.
Counterparty		Sitara		Pipeline		Comment Midland Cogen		332163		PEPL		Changed volume from 0 to 5,000 per day Midland Cogen		340362		TRKL		Changed volume form 0 to 6,800 per day
