I have been updated by Susan on her (largely futile) efforts to push ECS on  the $200k we think they owe us.
Martha, please get me a half hour Tuesday  with Susan, James and Kevin so we can decide how to get closure on this.
If  I understand ECS' position, their argument is that CDEC stonewalled and  delayed granting access to the critical website and therefore its not ECS'  fault that manual peak monitoring wasn't operational until December .
That  argument, it seems to me, is BS because we never heard even a shred of  warning or request for help from ECS on getting things moving, right?
At  minimum, TW could have raised holy hell with TriState and CDEC management to  get things moving if we knew that ECS was stymied.
But we heard nothing.
Is  that our story?
If its going to take me doing some yelling at Knippa or Steve and Rod talking  to Redmond, lets decide what the script is and get it done.
