Just wondering if you had a chance to comment on the "advisory memo" to be  sent to the Enron subs/affiliates regarding brokerage agreements.
I have no  real deadlines, only a self-imposed deadline so that we can get this thing  organized and running on a regular basis.
I would appreciate your input.
I'll be out of the office Feb. 3 7&4; maybe we can chat early next week.
Thanks.
Sara
