Hello,  In order to make sure that our records are complete during the holiday season, could you please forward a copy of your quote sheets to Chance Rabon at Chance.Rabon@enron.com, as well as sending them to me.
I will be on holidays from Friday 21st, till the end of the year and Chance will be helping clean up Enron business and be preparing for our business to re-emerge.
Your patients and help are greatly appreciated and I look forward to speaking with you in the new year.
Have a happy and safe holiday season.
Jon
