Susan: It's not clear to me what needs to be done on the file.
Has Paul contacted  them about his note on 4/7?
If not, call Paul and find out if he wants you  to make that call as that seems like the logical next step to take.
As far  as their other comments, we cannot delete the Recording language on page 6  and in the Confirmation language let's offer up 5 Business days.
