Just in case anyone had any doubts about how Davis is approaching the  issue......  Davis announces four new energy advisors   Updated: May 18, 2001 - 2:54 p.m.  Gov.
Gray Davis has added four new advisers to his energy staff, including  members of former Vice President Al Gore's staff and campaign team.
Chris Lehane, former Gore press secretary, and Mark Fabiani, a deputy  campaign manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential run, will coordinate the  governor's communications staff on energy issues and help recruit a new  director of communications.
Lehane and Fabiani's company will earn $30,000 per month for six months.
Nancy McFadden, former deputy chief of staff to Gore, will earn $118,000 a  year as a senior adviser to the governor, said Steve Maviglio, Davis'  spokesman.
McFadden will concentrate on the governor's relations with federal  regulators and with generators.
Davis also has recruited Kellan Fluckiger, chief operations officer for the  Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power grid.
Fluckiger is "on loan" from the ISO, and will work with energy suppliers,  Maviglio said.
