I've made a change to a LTNW deal, per Mike Driscoll and John Malowney,  because it was entered against the wrong index yesterday.
Cara asked me to  e-mail you with the specifics for any scheduling adjustments that need to be  made.
And here they are -  563929 - KILLED  476578 - Legs 4, 5, and 6 added to extend deal through April  Because this is an index-forward deal, it needed to be entered against the  on-peak, off-peak, and Sunday indices, which explains the three new legs.
Let  me know if you have any questions.
Kate
