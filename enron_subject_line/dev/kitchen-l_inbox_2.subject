I still get 7-8 people every day whining about the "trading vs marketing th= ing".
Some of it is ridiculous but some of it could go away if we changed = a few things.
Either we call every commercial person a trader or we period= ically acknowledge the existence of marketers.
I vote for the latter.
The = employee presentation talked about "trading and operations groups", the onl= ine materials talked about "trading staff and technology", the ubs spokespe= rson today in the news article said "625 traders and support people", and s= aid the traders are "talking to customers about getting contracts in place"= .
Tim's assistant tried to pull rank on my assistant because "we are a tra= ding company now"!!
The invites for the credit and legal meetings were call= ed "trader meetings".
The master agreement references the trading business= .
NETCO.
In isolation, all of these things are trivial.
Add it all up, we=  have a problem.
We lost some of our better marketers due to this issue - = I don't want to lose more in 6 or 12 months.
This is not a ying-yang issue:.
I am thrilled about this deal closing, but = we need to fix this or else we will have a nonproductive group of expensive=  personnel.
