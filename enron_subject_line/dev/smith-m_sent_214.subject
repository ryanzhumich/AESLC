David,  This one is very similar to the one you just did.
In fact, the data is  almost identical.
We download power plant outage data from the California  ISO website (manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated  scrape).
Anyway, the data gets into an Access database of mine in a table  with key fields:  Date and Res Name.
The other fields include Type (planned  or unplanned), Owner, Location, plant capacity, and of course, the quantity  of the outage.
So, we need basically the large table as the one you did  which lists each plant and the outage for "today" and let's say 1 week in the  past.
We cannot go in the future because the data gets posted daily for that  day only.
Then the other table will just summarize the total "Planned" and  "Unplanned" by region.
A copy of the database is attached.
Let me know  when you have a chance to start working on it.
Thanks.
Mat
