Attached are clean and redline versions of my revisions to the  Confidentiality Agreement.
Please Note:  1.
I am not sure is the paragraph concerning US Technical Data is  necessary.
If it is, what are we receiving and what type of obligations  would we have?
2.
Need to get as specific as possible concerning the project in the first  paragraph.
I will be in a due diligence this afternoon and most of tommorrow.
I will be  checking voice mail.
