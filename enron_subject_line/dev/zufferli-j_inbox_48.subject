Tricia, John has a stock option amount reported on his final pay stub that needs to be adjusted.
The amount represents taxes on stock options and restricted stock exercised in 2001.
The stock option numbers on the memos sent by PaineWebber are correct, however, the restricted stock exercise should not be reported on the T4 (as per verification by Dave Peters at PriceWaterhouseCoopers on Jan 2/02).
Please make the appropriate adjustments so that the T4 is correct and advise me when corrected.
Thanks!
