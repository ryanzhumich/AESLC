Team,  The attached spreadsheet identifies the manual entry points for each  pipeline.
Please send me additional points for your respective pipelines and  highlight in green.
Make particular note of any information that will be  tracked on a schedule other than the standard cycle schedule of the relative  pipeline.
The blue highlighted meters already exist in the database.
Where  appropriate add the IHS DRN.
If it does not exist, leave blank and the IT  group will create an ID using the description provided.
Please let me know  if you cannot get this done by the end of the day, since I'd like Hyde to  incorporate these first thing tomorrow.
Call me if you have any questions.
Mat
