Approval was received from the Texas Railroad Commission to discontinue  groundwater monitoring at the Pucket Plant.
As you may remember,  Transwestern constructed a permitted landfill to dispose of the entire  facility near Ft. Stockton.
Groundwater montioring activities have been  ongoing since aprox.
1988.
A permit condition states that if three years of  groundwater sampling data confirms that the groundwater protection standard  has not been exceeded, the groundwater monitoring activities can be  terminated.
A letter from Leslie Savage granting this approval was received  on July 14, 1999.
Ken Gray, all other conditions of the permit are still in effect (noxious  weed and mesquite control, monthly site inspections recordkeeping etc.....).
Continue to keep the records accurate and up to date.
I anticipate that we  will be required to monitor  and conduct housekeeping activities at the site  indefinately.
