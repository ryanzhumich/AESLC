As most of you know, Monique Sanchez has resigned and will be leaving Enron October 12.
Monique is moving to Salt Lake City with her fianc?
and will be living in Deer Valley.
We congratulate Monique on her move and thank her for all of her contributions to the west desk.
We will plan a going away dinner for Monique before she leaves.
