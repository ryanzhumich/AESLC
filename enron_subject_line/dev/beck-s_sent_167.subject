Hector has still referred to the key players under Jeff Gossett as managers.
However, only one of these (Will Kelly) is a manager.
The remainder are  senior specialists.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of this in  detail.
We are potentially exposed for Steve Jackson to hire some of these  players away.
Steve is going to have deliverables at his new employer, our  competitor, which will require that he have good people.
He will be moving  to Columbus, Ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire.
He does know these risk specialists here, and being young and single or  childless, their mobility factors could be high.
Enron would not want to  lose any other talent to Steve's new employer.
