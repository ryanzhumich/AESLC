Hi, Mark.
The itinerary is changing a little bit with regard to where you  are staying while in Africa, so I will forward the latest and greatest as  soon as I get it.
Probably sometime late this week...  Just wanted to be sure that you are working on getting your Tanzanian visa  and getting the required shots.
Congratulations on the new job - I guess this means you'll be staying for a  while?
