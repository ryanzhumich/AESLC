Christie,  Shirley reserved room 49C1 for Monday 4:00 p.m.  presentation.
Can you  issue the formal invitation to our guests with the game/dinner details?
I don't have all the details regarding the Enron Field box and time.
I am out most of the day on Wednesday but we can discuss the details on Thursday.
Hope to see you on Saturday at  the concert.
