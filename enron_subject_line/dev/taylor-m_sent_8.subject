Mark Haedicke, Greg Whalley and I will be meeting with several people at the  NYMEX on Friday morning.
It's possible (although not likely) that Dan  Rappaport will attend one of the meetings.
I remember that we were very  unhappy with his testimony earlier this year and I know we delivered that  message to the NYMEX a couple of times.
What I'm not sure of is whether  their testimony was toned down at all in subsequent hearings.
Are you aware  of the content of the NYMEX testimony at those hearings and whether or not  our complaints had been taken to heart when it was prepared?
I'm just  wondering if there is anything we should bring up in our meetings if  Rappaport does attend - either positive or negative.
I also heard just a few minutes ago that Mark H. had cancelled our trip to DC  currently scheduled for 12/16 since he will be meeting with Commissioner  Newsome tomorrow.
It might make sense to leave the December meeting on the  calendar, though.
Seems to me the Enron message may get lost in the overall  background noise of a big ISDA meeting.
Maybe I can come up alone and we can  do a scaled down version of the originally scheduled meeting to get some solo  time in the Commissioner's face.
What do you think?
