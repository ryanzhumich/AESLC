So Burton hits me with "I hear you drink like a fish.
Supposedly you were  slamming them back last night."
When I asked where he garnered such  information he told me "From our friend on 28."
I promptly sent the  following message "Nice...so do you inform everyone you come in contact with  that I drink like a fish?"
Result, no response to me but he called Burton to  lambast him for ratting him out.
And the eternal question remains, if no  longer interested why care so much?
