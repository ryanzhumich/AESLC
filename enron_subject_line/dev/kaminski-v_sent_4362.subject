Celeste,  I was under the impression I sent you a message regarding Brad Romine but I cannot find a copy in my msg folder.
There might have been a glitch in the  CC-mail and the message did not go through and wasn't  stored.
I wanted to make the following points:  1.
Brad will not show up on March 15.
He is still working on his dot-com  business and wants to pursue this opportunity.
2.
My recommendation is that we should draw a line in the sand.
Either Brad  or a stipend refund check should show up on March 15.
3.
I told Brad that  a failure to show up on March 15 will not imperil his  future employment opportunities with Enron.
We just need clarity and ability to plan our human resource  needs.
If he decides to re-apply at some point in the future, we shall not hold his  decision  to pursue him  entrepreneurial plans against him.
Please, let me  know what you think.
Vince
