monika and dave,  as mentioned during our phone conversation, i am enclosing the original spread sheet that was developed to capture both the morphological aspects of various fibers as well the pulp qualities for different wood species.
also, the spreadsheet that dan T has provided with by enron, under fiber morphology , and under hardwood broadleaf  species, southern mixed hardwood (Hi Oak and Low Oak) and mixed tropical hardwoods are listed.
for this category only pulp characteristics can be provided but not fiber morphology.
so, please check that too.
if you have questions, please call me ((864) 676-5636) or dan T.  thanks.
