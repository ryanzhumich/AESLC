Cathy,  The subject contact that you faxed to me appears to be their standard  interruptible 311 contract.
t is a month to month interruptible contract.
I  see no reason why it should not be signed.
Please call me if you need  anything further.
I will be in the AEP Houston Metro building office  starting on Monday.
