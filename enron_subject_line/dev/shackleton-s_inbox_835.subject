I spoke w/ Johnny Nor at Navajo today.
I told him that ENA could not wait any longer for Navajo's decision.
They have until 4PM Houston time TODAY, 3/20/02 to get a termination to ENA (via Stephanie Panus' fax: 713-646-4818).
He understands that if they do not terminate today ENA will terminate Navajo TODAY.
He gave me his fax number, 505-748-6742 (note that this is different from the fax number used for the demand letter).
Susan: Notes for the DDL.
Stephanie: Please watch the fax for a document from Navajo.
Sara: Based on the conversation w/ Nor I think we should be prepared to send a termination.
(Don't think Navajo will terminate.)
Call if you have questions.
