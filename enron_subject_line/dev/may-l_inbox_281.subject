I just wanted to let you all know that I really enjoyed working with you all.
It has been a pleasure and a ton of fun to work for such great people.
I hope to stay in contact with you and please keep hold of my email address and resume for anything you may see a need for in the future.
Also if you wouldnt mind being a reference for me it would be greatly appreciated and you can email me your information.
Thanks again,
