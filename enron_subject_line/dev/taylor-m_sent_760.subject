Is it possible to pinpoint the sources of the rumors we discussed yesterday?
If so, it might be possible to maintain an action against the culprits.
I'm  not sure exactly what it might be - possibly for slander or tortious  interference with contract, something like that.
I could discuss it with our  friend Richard Sanders but it would be a waste of time if we can't identify  the perpetrator.
