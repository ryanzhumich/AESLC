i talked to david fleisig at pg&e last night.
he begged for simple term sheet that could be flushed out in definitive documentation.
would you add the following for people to comment on in the term sheet: we will oppose the assessment of an underscheduling penalty at the ferc.
they will oppose the assessment of any surcharge to da customers by the cpuc for any of their undercollections.
we will both cooperate to either get ferc alj approval of the settlement or if we waive this requirement in our discretion (e.g.
if some holdup there/we want to close fast), they will immediately pay to us any refund that we end up paying that goes to them.
