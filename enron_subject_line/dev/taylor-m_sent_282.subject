Richard Sanders has asked us to revise the arbitration language in our forms  - including the Omnibus Annex A.
Please give some thought to whether there  are any other revisions we should make at this time.
We make every effort to  minimize the frequency with which we change the Annex (it has only been  changed once since its inception) so it is important that we get as many  necessary changes made at this time as possible.
