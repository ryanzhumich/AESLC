Greetings!
I hope that we can make certain plans to meet when I am in Sao  Paulo and to have a telephone conversation this week.
I will arrive in Sao Paulo on Sunday, Sept. 19.
Andrea Bertone and I will be  meeting with Jose Emilio on Monday, Sept. 20. regarding physical trading  matters.
Would you be able to meet with me at Enron's office on either  Tuesday or Wednesday, Sept. 21 (preferably) or Sept. 22 to discuss certain  aspects of financial trading?
I will be able to clarify the specific issues  this week.
I would also like to schedule a telephone call this week, say  Wednesday or Thursday to discuss.
Please e-mail me as to whether we can meet  in Sao Paulo.
I will try to call you today.
Let me know if you have a  convenient time.
Sara
