Okay...good news...they are playing all 4 lines at 7:00pm.
I think their strongest line 1 player is out of town, but I think the rest of their team is still pretty good.
Chancellors is at 6535 Dumfries.
Dumfries is one block South of S.Braeswood, and the club is one block East of Fondren.
If you are coming from 610 S., go west (left) on S. Braeswood,  left (south) on Fondren, and left on Dumfries.
There's not a light, but I believe there is a left turn lane.
