Maria, please take a look at this list of "Reference Entities" and the  attached memo.
I doubt we have any reason to knock out any of the listed  entities based on legal controversies, etc., but its worth a check .
From  the attached memo, it looks like a more likely reason to disqualify an entity  would be credit problems or some other commercial issue.
I'm in a bind today  and out the rest of the week so it would be helpful if you could pick this  ball up in my absence.
Please get back to me and Mike with the results of  your analysis.
Thanks.
DF
