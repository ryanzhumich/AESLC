Need your book list from amazon.com!!!!
May sleet and snow tonight but I think the ground is too warm to  stick or get icy.
Although I could use a day off work!
Send me your christmas list!
Also, I see that Enron and Dynegy have been negotiating for days.....this concerns me.
they cannot seem to come up with a new price.
Are you continuing to lose trading?
what % of normal trades are you now doing a day?
I just hope you and Matthew are OK.  And Jeannie.
Let me know.
Love you, Mom.
