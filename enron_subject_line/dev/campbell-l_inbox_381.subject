The invoices for December 1999 settlement adjustments will be posted by 23:00 today, Friday, September 28, 2001.
The NYISO apologizes for any inconvenience resulting in the delay in posting these invoices.
Transmission  Customers  will  observe adjustments to their settlements to: (1)  recover  costs  related  to  adjustments  made  outside of the billing process;  (2)  adjust regulation penalty charges to zero for suppliers; and (3)  adjust  the  NYISO  clearing account balance to zero for December 1999 settlements.
With  regard  to the adjustments made outside of the billing process, these adjustments  could not have been corrected by a billing code or determinant data fix.
As a result, the mechanism of paying and funding the adjustments is   done  outside  of  the  billing  process.
The  total  adjustment  of $581,563.37  was  allocated  across 13,147,961 MWh.
Customers may validate their  respective  adjustments  by  computing  their  ratio  shares  of the $581,563.37  using  5,059,790  MWh  as  the denominator in their respective ratios of their December 1999 load.
Customers will observe a difference in the  denominators  used  in  the  ratio share allocation of this adjustment versus  adjustment  #3.
This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the costs for adjustment  #1 are not allocated to those that received payment through the adjustment, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment.
Prior  to  October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the revenue   received  from  Schedule  1  charges,  which  were  comprised  of forecasted  uplift  & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred by  adjusting  subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly.
In October 2000,  the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions that  allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred.
In  order  to  allow  any  changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be settled  through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market.
This results in an  over-collection  which  is  being  returned  to  Customers  through  an adjustment  to  their  monthly  balances.
This  billing treatment for the December  1999  settlement  adjustments  resulted  in credits to the market totaling  $5,219,402.09  allocated  across 13,191,237 MWh.
Customers where allocated their portion of adjustment #3 above, based upon their respective ratio shares of the 13,191,237 MWh of NYISO transmission service billed for the month.
December  1999  settlement adjustment settlement dates have been changed to address  the  delay  in  invoicing.
Payments due to the NYISO for December 1999  settlement  adjustments  are due to be received in the NYISO clearing account  on  Monday, October 15, 2001.
Payments due to market participants will  be  made on Friday, October 19, 2001.
