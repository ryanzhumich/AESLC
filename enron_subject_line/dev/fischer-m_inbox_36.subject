In the next few days, you will receive your ID and temporary password for the Financial Data Warehouse / Business Objects from the ISC.
When you do, take these three steps which will enable you to identify the additional reports and data items needed to perform your work: Logon and install Business Objects via the intranet; Review the existing Corporate Reports, and take the two ISC Training Courses for Business Objects (one is an on-line training courses available anytime and the other is a classroom style course where you get hands-on experience).
First, logon to the Project Sunrise website and install the Business Objects web client: open your Microsoft Internet Explorer, enter the Project Sunrise site address sunrise.corp.enron.com into the address field and press enter, when prompted, enter your ID (with a capital P) and your temporary password follow the directions in the ISC's instructions that will be sent with your ID/password to install Business Objects over the intranet.
(if this takes more than 3 minutes, call me at 3-9047).
DO NOT GET BUSINESS OBJECTS INSTALLED BY THE IT GROUP, AS THIS IS THE WRONG VERSION (WINDOWS).
then Refresh your Report List and start reviewing the reports.
The ISC's instructions will also cover the steps to select and run reports, (but please call me with any issues).
Second, review the existing reports in the "Corporate Documents" tab and identify the additional reports your need to perform your work and meet your customers' needs.
Current report subjects include Cost Centers, Project Systems and on or about November 1st  will also include Profit Centers, Consolidations, Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable.
Third, take the two training courses to learn how to analyze data in drill mode, add other data warehouse fields to existing reports, etc.
Once you have this ability, you can also determine which additional data fields need to be added to the Financial Data Warehouse to complete your reporting requirements.
To enroll in the on-line and classroom Business Objects courses, Logon to the Enron Learning Management site elm.enron.com scroll to the bottom of the first pages and select ISC Courses Scroll down to the middle of page two, click on Business Objects and enroll in the following: BusinessObjects  On-line Training Course for Financial Reporting  (BO 101)  Price - none BusinessObjects  Financial Reporting Basics  (BO 202)  Price - $250  Classroom/hands-on training.

Project Sunrise is in the process of identifying and designing its final deliverable now, so we need to identify our reporting needs quickly.
