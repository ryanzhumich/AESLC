Hi Jim,  The shipping quote to your door is 269.00/game.
There was know price break on two or more because they had to be but on individual pallets.
Here are some pictures of what I have available in the classic games.
I almost forgot to tell you.
We have a brand new gauntlet Legends 4 player in a dedicated Cabinet available for only 2,195.00 this game was 3995 new a year ago.
It is brand new and never been used.
It's a great buy if you like action adventures games.
I think your kids will like it.
Also 4 players can play at the same time.
It a great game with lots of hidden treasures and secret doors.
We only have two units left and I think the skating rink in League City, TX is going to get one.
Also would you want us to set them on free play for you or do you want to use quarters to make them work.
It's your choice.
It's the last picture title Gauntletebay.jpg  Let me know if you have made any decisions  Thanks,
