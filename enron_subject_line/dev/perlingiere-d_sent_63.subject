Further to our collective conversations yesterday,   I have contacted counsel  for CES and have sent   via fax the Consents of Assignment for both parties  for execution stressing the need for a quick turn around.
Upon execution,  I will amend the agreements for new pricing.
Please let me know if you have an questions or comments.
