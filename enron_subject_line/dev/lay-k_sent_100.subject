Linda, before we knew that you and Ken were going to the VIP reception, Ken  had me ask if others could attend in your place.
I did ask and they have  just called me that Nancy Kinder said that it is o.k.
for the Vermeils and  the Herrolds to attend, in addition to you and Ken.
They did ask if we would  not spread it around as others have asked and they have not let them.
Oh, but Beau just called that Heather is ill and they are cancelling.
