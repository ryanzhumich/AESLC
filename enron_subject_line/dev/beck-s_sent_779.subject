All eight students that we interviewed for the Enron Scholarship were great  and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules  next year when they are in the second year of the MBA program.
I don't want  to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us.
Karen's  letter (noted below) is a good idea, but we should augment that by getting  these students names on our radar screen for next year.
I will find out who  the recruiter is for UT MBA's and I will get copies of the students' resumes  and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter.
