Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward  under the structure we have discussed.
FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that  vest based upon 60MW of orders;   - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about  the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that  call;   - the transaction is fully press released immediately.
CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide  the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development    opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW;   - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing  at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL.
I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all  press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory  filings.
I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we  manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.
Thanks
