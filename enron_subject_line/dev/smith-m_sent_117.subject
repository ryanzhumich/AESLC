We need to work out a system here Kristen.
Why is it you are so freakin hard  to get in touch with?
I asked you how often you check email, but you've  never told me, once a day, week, what?
And this cell phone thing...Do you  have it with you all the time...is it on...if not, how often do you check  voicemail...how long after I leave a message should I expect to here from  you?
I'm generally impatient, which is why it kills me to wait to hear from  you, especially when I have not idea of what time frame to expect.
Anyway, I really need to make plans, otherwise I'm going to go to Utah with  Dave, or San Fran, or Puerto Rico.
