FYI - Beth Apollo led the doorstep review in Monterrey last week.
No  problems discovered - but Beth did find some communications and system access  issues that could be improved to make it easier for Max's team to do their  jobs.
She has quickly identified a point person within Operations in Houston  who is bi-lingual (Gordon).
Max's note addresses his pleasure over Beth's  responsiveness and the doorstep process in general.
Just wanted to pass this  along.
