Anne,  I still haven't received any pay stubs since I have been in Houston.
Can I  get copies of those somehow?
Could you send my something in the inter-company  mail so I can see if my mail stop has been really been changed?
I haven't  received any mail of any kind which seems kind of weird.
Thanx   Chris Dorland  (P.S.
thanx for the PRC info.)
