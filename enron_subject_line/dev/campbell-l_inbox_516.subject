ADesell@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Due to the terrorist actions in NYC which collapsed offices in the World Trade    Center complex and reduced customer Load in that Transmission District,    the    ISO is re-calculating the Unforced Capacity ("UCAP") requirement for the    Consolidated Edison Transmission District (CETD) and the New York    Control    Area.
The new UCAP requirement for the CETD for the Capability Period    11/1/01 to 4/31/02 is 12788 MW and the total UCAP requirement for the    New York Control Area is 32892 MW.
Changes in the UCAP requirements    of affected LSEs will be provided to them, individually, today.
The table below provides a comparison of the revised UCAP requirements    to those in effect prior to this revision.
