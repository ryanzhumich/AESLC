FYI  WPS owns about 20 mw of Yarmouth 4 (often referred to as Wyman)  (9800 heat rate) in Maine and is making this indicative offer to CPs for cal 02...  $5 capacity payment plus actual fuel costs (#6, 0.7% sulfur) - they report a current bid at around $4.75  I have asked them to provide history of : forced outage, actual oil costs compared to index, reduced output due to congestion constraints (this last summer), and other information.
Until we get this and other information I told them we could not properly evaluate the value of this opportunity.
