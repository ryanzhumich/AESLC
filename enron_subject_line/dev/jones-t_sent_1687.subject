1.
What is the heading styed "Derivatives Trading"?
I think that should be  "Credit Derivatives".
2.
Move "Gas Trading" and "Emerging Markets Trading" to the end of the list,  since I never have any responses from those groups.
3.
I need you to fix the boxes where I click for approved, "yes", "yes, with  limitations", or "no", so I can unclick them if I click them by mistake.
4.
Like we have the sort for Houston or London, I need a sort for  "EnronOnline" and "ClickPaper".
I will maintain my approvals for each of  those separate online trading databases in the same database.
5.
I need a new category for "Pulp & Paper Financial".
Can you get these done ASAP, since I am sure by now you have gotten your rush  from last week done....  As usual, your help is always appreciated!
