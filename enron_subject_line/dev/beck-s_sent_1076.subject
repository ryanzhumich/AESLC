FYI - Despite the fact that this an OU student, I thought that you would find  this note interesting.
Since we compete with Big 5 for talent at several  schools, we should be aware of the make up of some of their job offers that  lure students to join them.
Paying for a masters degree at UVA ahead of  time is certainly an interesting piece of this job offer.
See note from Lexi  below.
