Howdie,  What's the new job?
I'm good for sushi any day next week (Tues-Fri).
Give me  a call or e-mail me.
I'm off to Kimberly snowboarding this weekend.
I've done some good  snowboarding trips lately (Lake Tahoe and Fernie).
Not making big $$$$$ lately but things are looking up.
Going to Santa Fe  grill for lunch (mmmm!).
You need to come check out my new home theater system, it's crazy!
See you next week,  Chris
