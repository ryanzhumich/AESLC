hey martin - i know i havent paid for the fantasy league at all - but i am  trying to figure out how much i owe - i think 3 of my transactions shouldve  been free because 1 was to change kickers on the same team and 2 were to  change my defense on the bye week - so, without any winnings - i think i owe  $145 - can you verify?
thanks.
also - can you tell me if i won anything for  making the semi-finals?
