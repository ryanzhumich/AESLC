John, we just received an invoice from the above company for an electronic tagging service agreement that Bill Greenizan had executed last year.
It is to renew the ETS agreement for an additional one year commencing March 10, 2002 and is in an amount of US$3,000.
I am unsure what the purpose is of the agreement and whether ECC or UBSW need to continue it.
Can you let me know what we should do with the invoice and agreement?
Thanks
