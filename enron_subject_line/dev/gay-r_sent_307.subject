Jana:  I would definitely like to have an analyst start as soon as possible.
Let me know what the procedure is (i.e.
do I interview, will an anlyst just  be assigned to me, etc.)
I had already talked to Mason Hamlin before, and he  opted for another rotation, although he was perffectly acceptable to me.
So  let me know what I need to do and when I could expect an analyst.
Also, a  new hire analyst is acceptable.
Thanks.
