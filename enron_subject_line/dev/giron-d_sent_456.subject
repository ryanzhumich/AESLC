I know this is very late notice, but up until yesterday I didn't think I was  going to be free on Saturday.
My brother-in-law is hosting a tournament on  Saturday at Cypress Lakes, which is just off of Hwy 290 at Cypress Rosehill.
In other words, BFE.
$70 will get you a round of golf, lunch, and beer.
He  will have a keg.
There will be prizes for the winners.
It is a four man  best ball scramble.
Tee time is early:  7:30am.
I sent this to guys I  either know play or think play.
If you have someone else in mind, feel free  to forward the message.
I don't have a team at all and wanted to see if  anyone was interested.
Let me know.
