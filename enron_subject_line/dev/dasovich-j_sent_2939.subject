Few things: Linda:  Thanks very much for the call and the help.Tyson is calling John Doer  (sp?)
to try to get him in the loop.
And she agreed to send the proposal to  Summers today.
Proposal to follow.
I'm working with a guy named Phil Verleger (MIT economist type who worked in  Ford and Carter), who I met at the meeting on Saturday, to come up with a  list of individuals with Democratic, contributor, business community  credientials that can be contacted to seek support for the proposal.
Any  suggested contacts that folks have would be helpful.
John Nesslage (who works for Jim) is running some numbers to get an idea of  the size of rate increases required to pay back the loans under a 10-year  term structure The UC  Berkeley econ/biz school faculty members I met with on Saturday want  to issue a press release stating there view on "what not to do" (i.e., don't  have the state take over anything, period).
They want to give us a copy to  review for comments/edits before they issue it.
I should be getting tonite  or first thing in the AM tomorrow.
May not go anywhere, but I told them that  I'd be happy to review it.
Jeff
