Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.
His resignation is effective immediately.
In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.
Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."
He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."
