Joe Hunter has asked me to draft a form of confirmation reply letter that we  could send to our counterparties in lieu of signing their confirmations.
This form of letter with the appropriate chnages could also be used by those  counterparties that we confirm.
Please let me know if you have any comments  on this form or any concerns about implementing this process.
Thanks.
Carol
