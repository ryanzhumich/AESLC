Your switchboard does not answer and I'd like to speak with you.
Please call  me at 713/853-5620.
We'll e-mail two identical Schedules to you in word.
Enron Capital & Trade  Resources entered into an ISDA with Barclays in 1995 and that Schedule was  virtually identical to the one we're sending.
We therefore do not expect  there to be many issues.
The banks should serve as Calculation Agents and  confirming agents so we will look to them for the confirmations.
Look  forward to finalizing these documents with you.
Thanks.
Sara
