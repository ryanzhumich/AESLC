Kurt Wipp is a recent hire in our London office to focus on origination/mid-market opps.
Kurt joins us after 15+ yrs w/ Methanex.
I've asked him to spend next week or so in Houston introducing himself to all the traders, originators, finance, RAC, Legal, etc...
I have given him most of your names and he will probably be contacting you to try and set up some time to meet.
My assistant, Beth Ryan, may also be coordinating some of the meetings.
Please take time to visit w/ him, even if only briefly and help him better understand your markets, perspectives, goals and objectives.
It's important that in addition to Kurt developing an understanding of our business strategies/opportunities that he also develop and accelerate his "Enron DNA."
Thanks in advance!
