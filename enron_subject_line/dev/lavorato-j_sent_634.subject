Mike,  Tonight John and I are going to be migrated to Outlook.
Please note that  John has a laptop computer that is at his home.
I have spoken with Randy  about this and he is to be following up with you.
I would like for you to  accompany Greg out to the Lavorato home to complete the migration on to his  computer.
Also, please note that I gave my and John's passwords to a lady that stopped  by my desk today (she is with the migration group).
Could you please confirm  for me tomorrow that they have been shreaded.
Thanks
