RAC came by and brought up a couple of concerns.
1- the Var on this deal is  over $120m (more than all of ENE combined); they wanted to make me aware of  the size, and they know we are working on it.
and 2 - EE&CC; they were  concerned about them doing the deal and their abilities and effects on MTM  treatment.
I told them that they can bid on it but we want others to bid and  that we probably won't use them.
They stated that the deal guys are acting  like EE&CC is a done deal.
Lets discuss.
Thanks,
