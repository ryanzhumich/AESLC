The proposed discipline below is designed to provide guidelines for HR generalists in addressing violations of the "Internet Security Policy for the use of Electronic Media and Services" to ensure consistency in the application of disciplinary measures.
In general, the discipline should follow the corrective action policy that has been established for addressing unacceptable conduct (see policy #11, corrective discipline).
The recommendations below are designed to address situations where employees transmit externally electronic communication that is "discriminatory, harassing, threatening, derogatory, obscene, defamatory, a "chain letter" or junk mail, untrue, fraudulent, illegal, against Company policy, contrary to the Company's interest or for personal profit" (as outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics).
First Offense:  Automated electronic warning that the system has detected an inappropriate electronic mail being sent from the employee's mail box and that another violation will result in the HR Representative and Supervisor being notified and possible disciplinary action.
Also warning message refers employee to Internet Security Policy.
Second Offense:  Second automated electronic warning to employee with copy to HR Rep and Supervisor.
HR Rep and Supervisor to verbally warn employee to ensure understanding of Company policy.
Third Offense:  Third automated electronic warning to employee with a copy to Supervisor and HR.
HR Rep and Supervisor to give Written warning to employee to be placed in PH file.
Written warning to state that further violation may result in termination.
Fourth Offense:  System notice of shut down for continuing violation.
Copy of notice sent to HR Rep and Supervisor.
HR Rep and Supervisor to consult with Legal depart prior to employee termination for misconduct.
Using these guidelines, it is suggested that the  HR Rep and Management consider the specifics of the offense and determine the appropriate corrective action.
Other Issues/Considerations: Should we carve out transmissions that are "untrue, fraudulent, illegal, against Company policy, contrary to the Company's interest and for personal profit" and have a more severe discipline for those situations?
Should same discipline be used when employees access inappropriate or pornographic sites.
Should we attempt to define all terms?
Is it appropriate to use a "one size fit's all" approach.
Should the discipline for transmitting motivational messages be the same as discipline for a threatening, obscene, derogatory, etc.
message?
How should we address inappropriate electronic messages transmitted internally?
Please route your comments to me or be prepared to discuss at our next meeting to be held Monday, July 23rd from 10:30 am to 11:30 am in EB 3824.
