Attached is a draft of an "operational control agreement" designed to address  the concerns stated in FERC's order approving the Gallup project.
We may or  may not actually file it as part of the required compliance filing, but will  describe it in detail in the "report" FERC ordered us to file.
The  substantive terms track the language that is already in the O&M Agreement.
Please give me or Susan a call with any questions or comments you may have.
We expect to file this by I believe the 12th of Feb.  or so.
Thanks.
DF
