Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on  Transwestern.
The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff  language and a proposed form agreement.
Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.
I am  distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue  about the larger issues first.
A few that come to mind are whether we want  to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the  option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC  should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future  capacity for shippers.
Please let me know your thoughts on these and any  other issues.
I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming  changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have  resolved the substantive issues.
Thanks.
