Carol:  I've been meeting with Jarrod about confirm templates.
Prior to the  departures of Shari, Lynda, et al, there was a move afoot to create an annex  of weather definitions which could be incorporated by reference into the  confirms (or added to the Schedule), either of which approaches would shorten  the confirms considerably.
Jarrod advises that the EOL T&C's for the  varioius weather products contain the basic information which can be drafted  in the annex.
Jarrod will send us the EOL T&C's.
I think it's a great idea.
Jarrod will also send the existing  weather templates (which may be slightly  different from those Shari gave us earlier).
We should verify that the  weather rep appears in the weather option templates (since we have agreed to  remove that rep from the Schedule).
Also, shouldn't we verify that all  weather trades are executed under NY law (they probably are anyway) since we  now have the opinion from the NY Office of General Counsel?
