Would it be okay if we went ahead and rolled the socal and baja transport in  sitara?
I would like to input the Socal transport through October 2001, San  Juan to PG&E Topock and Mojave Topock (ask Janie for the allocation in  April).
The Baja transport is through March 2002.
80000/d to Citygate and  20,000 to KRS off-system.
This will really help me monitor my physical index exposure on the curve.
Let's get together and discuss tomorrow.
Thanks,
