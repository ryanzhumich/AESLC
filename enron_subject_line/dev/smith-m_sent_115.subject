Brad,  What's up cuz?
Are the lights on in San Francisco?
I think it's only a  matter of time before the national guard comes in to prevent rioting in the  streets!
Anyway, I was just wondering what plans you have in the next month or so  because I want to go someplace and do something, but I'm just not sure what  yet.
I have a bunch of vacation I need to take and I'd rather not sit around  here and twidle my thumbs.
Let me know if you have any suggestions.
Mat
