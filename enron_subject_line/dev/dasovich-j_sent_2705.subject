I've been notified that the California Commissioner has cancelled the meeting  with stakeholders that had been scheduled for this afternoon.
He'd scheduled  it to discuss what the order the Commission intends to issue on Thursday  might look like.
It signals, at this point, that the utilities continue to  have a difficult time reaching agreement with the administration.
Will get  back with more as it develops.
