Doesn't strictly qualify as an origination opportunity, but through a  contact, I've met with some folks who have some pretty nifty network  hardware/software that offers some interesting possibilities w/respect to  network performance (optical routing technology).
I'd like to hook them up  with network folks, both a technical and a commercial person.
Anyone  suggestions?
Thanks.
Best,
