UNFORTUNATELY!!
work totalled interfered with my plans to go to the Masters  last weekend.
I was so mad I didn't even want to play golf.
I am over that  now and would like to play this coming weekend.
I can play Saturday morning  (need to finish by 2pm).
or Sunday morning.
I will be out of town Wednesday  thru Friday so just let Cindy know if anyone can play.
Have a good week.
