Rhonda: Enclosed is a new revised draft of the MEGA Consent marked against the draft  that they sent to us.
Here is what we have decided to do:  1.
As a condition to our execution of this Consent, we will execute an  amendment to the existing Master with Morgan to (a) insert collateral  provisions and (b) clean up some of the defined terms in the MEGA confirms.
I will draft the amendment and Christian will help you and Melissa develop  the language for the amendment that deals with the confirm clean-up.
2.
We need to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is  that establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and  each of Morgan and MEGA.
My revised draft of the Consent makes it clearer  how this cutoff date works.
3.
We need a contact from Morgan that we can send the form of amendment to.
Call me if you have any questions.
