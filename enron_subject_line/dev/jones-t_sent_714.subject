I understand there is a little confusion regarding what products we can trade  under the "Master Master"  for the referenced Counterparty.
It's not  surprising, it's a confusing master!
This is currently the only agreement we  have in place that contains terms for trading both physical and financial  transactions in one agreement.
There is a Master Trading Agreement dated February 22, 1996 in place between  ECT and  AIG Trading Corporation, now known as Sempra Energy Trading Corp.  (Global Contract Reference No.
96000160).
This agreement provides for  financial Swap, Option and Swaption transactions (excluding weather), and  further provides for physical natural gas transactions only.
It does not  provide for any other physical products.
Call me if you have any questions...
