Hi there.
I am attaching for the group's consideration a red line that I ran comparing  the current working draft (v4) with the draft John R. recently circulated to  Tax and Insurance.
I suggest that Pete Thompson keep the typewriter on this.
We are getting so  close to the end, I would really like to try to avoid confusion.
I am also attaching a clean copy of the current active version, and the  current list of issues under consideration.
I suggest we work through this  list and turn another draft before soliciting Cris/Herman and Lisa's  comments.
We should also give the ENA commercial reps the opportunity to  review it at that time.
Kay
