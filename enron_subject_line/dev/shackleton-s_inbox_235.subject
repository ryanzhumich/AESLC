There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.
The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like "Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"
The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.
The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe.
If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.
At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.
However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e.
Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.
If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively.
If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.
It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.
Thank you.
