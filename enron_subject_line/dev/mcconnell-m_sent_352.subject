Pup,  Mark and I are confirmed with flights.
Chris is not coming.
Where are you  staying, any good hotel ideas.
Mark had a room for 1 night by the stadium  but now i think we will fly in on Tues early afternoon and mess around Miami  and therefor  may want to stay closer to the city.
Any thoughts?
When are  you guys flying in?
