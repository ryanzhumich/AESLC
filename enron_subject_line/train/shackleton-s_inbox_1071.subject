Fimat accepted the Enron Corp guarantee so our trading line with then will be increased tomorrow (to approximately $15-16 million from $11 million.)
Fimat will have our trading line up to $20 million as soon as they complete their internal credit process.
The Soc Gen money is priced as follows:  Original margin:  LIBOR Variation margin: LIBOR + 5 bp   Warren will call John directly when the line is increased.
Thanks to everyone for all their help.
