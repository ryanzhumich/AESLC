Guys, attached you will find a completed 2001 Pro Forma budget needing Lavo's  review and then detailed review with each team.
This workbook has a number of worksheets including:  a) pkrs o&m - this details the o&m costs for the sold peakers assuming we  own throught Q2 - charged to the OOC;  b) driftPrepay - shows the detail as provided netting drift and pre-pay  expenses - not all that relevant if you assume that increasing drift will be  offset by larger monetizations;  c) Summary - overall completed income statement - note that non-external  capital charges are added back to reach EBIT;  d) commercial income - guts of the commercial budget;  e) group expenses - shows the detail on ENA net groups expenses, EIS/ENW/IT  non-allocable, corporate charges not allocated to specific commercial groups  and bonus/other comp;  f) HP&L - takes a cut at HP&L income statement and balance sheet in 2001  assuming a sale by the end of Q2 - this needs some sit down work with Redmond;  g) Balance Sheet Allocations - this defines by group the capital employed,  assets to be sold and new capital expenditures expected in 2001 - then  calculates a net capital and depreciation charge;  h) Balance Sheet - this defines the existing balance sheet with no  anticipated sales or increases by vehicle (ie) Enserco, JEDI, etc - merchant  investments are charged @ a blended rate of 15% and strategic investments are  charged @ a blended rate of 9%.
Two action items:  a) Print out for John - Commercial Income  & Summary worksheets for his  comment and review &  b) Start putting completed commercial packages together for  distribution/further comment by the business units in the next couple of  weeks - include detailed income statement, headcount, balance sheet  (including expected increases,decreases, capital charge and depreciation),  leave pages open for goals & objectives and target customer list.
I would  like to review format and detail for each group before distribution.
Regards
