Sorry for my hold up on this list.
I had an issue with the division/dba  approvals that I needed to resolve with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor.
We  will be issuing a policy (as soon as I draft it) about how to deal with  divisions/dba's in the future.
For this Koch counterparty:  Per my conversation with Stephanie, I am provisionally approving this  counterparty only with understanding that the online trading account name  gets amended to read as follows:  Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.
If the counterparty will not agree to this name change on its account let me  know, I will talk to the Koch lawyer.
(FYI, this is the way we styled the  ISDA Master Agreement, at the direction of the Koch lawyer.)
