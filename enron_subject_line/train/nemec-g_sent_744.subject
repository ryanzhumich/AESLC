How is it going?
Haven't talked to you in awhile.
It has been pretty busy  around here.
Trying to sell all these nasty assets.
I am leaving for your  homeland, Denver to experience the Rocky Mountain high for myself.
Just what  the hell was John Denver singing about anyway?
Let me know what's going on.
