Tana: Mark has asked me to handle the Mexico issues in connection with EOL  trading.
I understand that you have copies of what has been sent to and  received from Mexican counsel.
Could you before you leave tomorrow give me  copies of all correspondence as well as copies of the more current  questionnaires taht we have been sending out so that I can start following up  with them on Monday?
Thanks.
Carol
