we need to pass on penalties to counterparties who cut us on gas day of may  11.  many counterparties are swinging on eol deals, so  going foward we are  going to rank those counterparties to take the cuts.
as far as this deal  goes, the problems incurred were due to logistical issues.
we did rerank  wild goose for cycle 4, but pg&e did not allow for renoms on this cycle.
