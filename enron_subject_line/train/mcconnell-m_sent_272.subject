Joe,  FYI, you were invited to our off-site because we felt that our businesses  were so linked together and that we could all get on the same page with  regard to updates, vision and relationship building.
We also invited Paul  and Thor as the only other non-EGM people.
If you can make it would be great  but we do know how difficult it is to make it over.
Cheers,
