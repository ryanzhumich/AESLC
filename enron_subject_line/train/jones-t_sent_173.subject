I'm helping Alan Aronowitz out with a presentation he has to give on the  global energy markets and I was thinking that Paul recently did a  presentation and maybe there might be some good slides on the European  markets that I can pull in.
Can you locate, or find someone to locate,  Paul's presentation, and email it to me.
I hope you get out of work at a decent hour today.
I bet you could use a  beer with all the late nights you've been putting in.
How's the house going?
Thanks for your help!
