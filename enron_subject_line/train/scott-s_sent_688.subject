Scott,  Thanks for offering up your extra tickets to the game this weekend.
As it  turns out, I don't think I'll be needing them - My sister has extra tickets  next to she and my brother-in-law.
Hope you have a great time and maybe I'll  see you at the game (although given the crowd I'm not going to count on it).
Susan  - - Looks like Saturday's going to be a balmy 90...better bring a sweater.
