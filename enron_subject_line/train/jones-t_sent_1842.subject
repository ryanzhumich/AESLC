Have you heard anything back from Gas Natural with respect to getting their  signed guarantees on the Comercializadora Metrogas  and Gas Natural Mexico  trades?
I've been holding my Enron Guarantees as leverage in getting  theirs.
We are at the period in the confirms where we need to exchange  guarantees...
