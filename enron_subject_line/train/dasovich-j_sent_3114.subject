Hi Rosalee: Attached is a summary of the proposal that ENA filed today in response to the  RFP for power and gas issued by California's DWR.
Also attached is a copy of  the complete proposal.
Steve Kean asked that I forward it along to you.
Could you please print out a copy and forward it along to Ken Lay prior to  his departure for Washington D.C.?
Thanks very much.
All the best,
