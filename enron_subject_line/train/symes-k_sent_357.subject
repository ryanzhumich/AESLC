I've had a request from Matt Motley to begin receiving this table on a daily  basis.
Carla Hoffman said Bob Badeer had asked for it before, and for  whatever reason she held off distributing it to all the traders.
I'd like to know if there is some reason why we don't send the EOL table to  all the traders on a daily basis.
If not, may I copy them on this in the  future?
Thanks,
