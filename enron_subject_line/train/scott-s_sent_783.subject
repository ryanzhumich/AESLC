May there always be work for your hands to do,    May your purse always hold a coin or two.
May the sun always shine warm on your windowpane,    May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain.
May the hand of a friend always be near you, And may God fill your heart  with gladness to cheer you.
-- Irish Blessing
