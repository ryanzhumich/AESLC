Attached please find drafts of the following:  Notice Assignment and assumption agreement (with GE acknowledgement) Bill of sale Exhibits for bill of sale and for the notice  I expect that there will be sets of documents for CA Energy Development I and  CA Energy Development II.
CA Energy Development II will include a  transformer as well as a turbine generator set.
Please let me know if you have any comments.
