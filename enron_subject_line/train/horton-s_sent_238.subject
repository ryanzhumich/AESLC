After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE  business review, there are two areas that I think I need to understand  better.
The first is PGE's energy positions going forward and the financial  exposures to changing prices.
The second is the rate case.
I would be happy  to return to Portland to get a more in depth review with a much smaller cast  of players.
I am open to suggestions from you.
Given the status of the divestiture process, Jeff wants to make sure he (and  subsequently I) have a good handle on these two important issues.
Thanks!
