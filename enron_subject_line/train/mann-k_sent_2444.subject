I am scheduled to be out of the office Tues-Thurs of this week.
I will be in  New York with Mark Bernstein negotiating a term sheet for the Co Op City  deal.
This is one of the asset management deals I'm working on for the NE  Power Team.
I haven't confirmed with Mark that the trip is still on, so there is still  the possibility that it might cancel.
