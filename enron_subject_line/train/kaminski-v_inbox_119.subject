Matt,  I am sending you as promised the PowerPoint presentations about different units of the Research Group.
As you know, the current plan is to transfer 4 meteorologists from my group and 2 pure quants to the new company.
I have no commitments from the pure quant side at this point, so I cannot give you any specific names.
