Louie/Ed I know you guys are busy, but because of the emphasis Enron places  on ensuring that action items from consolidated audits are completed prior to  the action item completion date, I really need to know how Scott and I are to  proceed on the subsurface drilling activities for potential contamination at  the Bakersfield Fractionator.
The scheduled completion date for six of the  items is 6/30.
I understand the there is an issue concerning Koch's  individual and shared responsibility for some of the issues identified during  the audit.
Rich Jolly has contacted me asking me when the drilling will  begin, as he does not want to see us exceed the 6/30 date and have the items  show up as deliquent in his region.
Whatever you can do to assist us in  either initiating the investigations or placing a hold on the drilling would  be greatly appreciated.
