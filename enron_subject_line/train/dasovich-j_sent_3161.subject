Hey gang: I think that we should do the case.
I'm willing to help draft, and willing  to take a first crack at putting some bullets together about the direction I  think the memo ought to take and distribute that by about 5 PM tomorrow.
Though it would be good for other folks to do same and then we could compare  notes.
Makes sense?
Thoughts?
Suggestions?
Best,
