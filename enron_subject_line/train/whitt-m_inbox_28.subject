sometimes things really suck out loud, don't they?
I still plan on coming  into the office tomorrow.
Like I said, maybe we just need to ride it out  and things will be fine...and we'll all live happily ever after!
(keeping  my finger and legs crossed)  Still feel like going out on Friday?
Maybe we  should do it downtown somewhere.
Comedy works first then dancing?
Keep  your chin up you handsome devil!
