This morning it was discovered that a portion of John Arnold's Gas Daily  position was being captured incorrectly as a February fixed price position  instead of a February Index position.
I am currently working on  the problem  and the positions will be captured correctly tonight.
John is aware of the  situation and has stated that V@R does not need to be re-run.
Thanks,
