Front to backs are huge Is the delivered basis market holding value or is it getting crushed?.
Heard about el paso oct feb roll, from where I'm at, thinking selling Oct and going long Feb phys is better than feb merc, rather stack length in winter front and bet on hording of existing storage given forecast At these levels I like owning winter physical against NYMEX short?Is the bias that the EFP's blow out further?
