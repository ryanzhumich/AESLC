Just curious - did you ever catch up with Larry Joe Hunter regarding the Long  Term Southwest desk's futures deal with Sempra?
I'm wondering if I should  grab Matt Motley before he goes home today to let him know he needs to get a  hold of Tim Cannon about the ADT.
Let me know when and if you talk to him.
Thanks,
