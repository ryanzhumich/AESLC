Mike,  The transaction agreement (2000-90crfm.doc) still needs to be finalized by  including the missing information to be added in the blanks as well as  finalization of the price to be applicable.
The contract documents should be  in final form and ready for signature.
Please review both documents and let  me have your comments.
If the documents meet with your approval, please  forward to Ami Beard for her review.
I will be in the office all day  tomorrow.
