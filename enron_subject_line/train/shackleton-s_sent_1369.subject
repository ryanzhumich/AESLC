Monica:  Since our recent conversation, I thought that you were going to send  me the entire format for the European format for the repos.
Also, have you  had an opportunity to review the existing repo between Chase and Enron North  America Corp. (formerly Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) dated as of  January 29, 1998?
I look forward to hearing from you.
