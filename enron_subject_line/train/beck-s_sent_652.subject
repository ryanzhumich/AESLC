1) Y2K Team:  Let me know if you would like to send a notes mail message from  you to the individuals that were here on Saturday, January 1 for the Y2K  testing.
I have created an address list that contains those names that I  could forward to Susan Skarness to use for that purpose.
2) Draft Memo from Rick Causey:  Attached is a draft memo that Rick Causey  proposes to send this week that describes a coordination role that I will  play on certain operational policies and procedures that should be  coordinated in all trading locations.
I have left you some comments  regarding this on my voice mail.
I would welcome your comments or  questions.
