I spoke to Peter Keohane while you were gone about that Canadian interest  change question we asked him.
You'll see, he sent us both a fax with  proposed changes to that section.
When you have a minute, let's chat about what Peter told me.
It wasn't a  clear answer of what to do, so we need to decide which way we want to go on  this.
