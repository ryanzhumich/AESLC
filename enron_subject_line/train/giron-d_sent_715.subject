Kim,  How are you?
I got your address from Sean and wanted to make sure it  worked.
I just sent a note to your dad asking if he was going to be in town  for the weekend of November 11th.
I plan on taking the whole group up for  the KU-UT game.
I hope you will be in town as well.
Let me know.
Take care.
DG
