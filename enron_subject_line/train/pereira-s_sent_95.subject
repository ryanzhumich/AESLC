Do you know if we have actually collected on the imbalance settlement  payments from Koch and LIG?
Also, are we in agreement with El Paso on the  Stingray imbalance volume (11,973 mmbtu due Stingray)?
I have a statement  from El Paso showing this volume.
They want us to sign and return the volume  statement.
Thanks,
