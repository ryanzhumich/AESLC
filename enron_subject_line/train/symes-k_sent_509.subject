I've added two new swaps to reflect the change from the California PX to the  Dow Jones index after 1/31/01.
The following deal numbers cover the whole  term of the deal.
404980 - 9/1/00 through 1/31/01 @ PX NP15 Index 512726 - 2/1/01 through 8/31/03 @ DJ NP15 Peak Index 512743 - 2/1/01 through 8/31/01 @ DJ NP15 Off-Peak Index  Both new deals have comments that link them back to the original deal.
Let me  know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
