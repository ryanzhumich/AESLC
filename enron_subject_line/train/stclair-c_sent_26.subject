Suzanne: If Bill gets his act together I will hand you an invitation to our party  tomorrow, but here are the details:  Saturday, April 22, 5-7.
If you have  some time, please stop by this afternoon and hopefully I can narrow down what  I want to order.
Alos, have you had any kluck in getting some Enron stuff  for my JA class?
