Suzanne: I may be in tomorrow but I will leave you a voice mail message one way or  another.
If I don't come in and I haven't used my discretionary day, please  use that, otherwise treat it as a vacation day.
Hope you have a great  weekend.
Be safe!
If it is slow tomorrow afternoon, I have no problem with  you leaving around 4:30 or so.
Carol
