My name is Terrie Sechrist and I am the Service Unit Cookie Manager for Bending Bayous this year.
I know that you were the cookie managers for your troop(s) last year.
I do not have confirmation as to who the cookie managers are for your troops this year.
Will you please respond to this email and let me know if you are a cookie manager for a troop this year?
If you are not your troop's cookie manager, would you please (if you know) tell me who is this year's manager (please include the troop number(s) in your return email.
I have sent out three emails to the troop managers today and would like to get the information to your troop's manager as soon as possible.
Thanks for your help!
