Just got off the phone with outside counsel for Credit Agricole.
We're very  close.
Tanya:  Can you tell me what products we trade?
Are there many outstanding  transactions?
Also, I'd like to make sure that the "credit worksheet" is  current.
It looks like we're working off of something dated 1/31/96 (Terry  Donovan!!!!!).
This must be wrong.
