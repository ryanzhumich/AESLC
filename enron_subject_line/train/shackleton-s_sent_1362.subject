Rick:  With a little luck, I can attach the first page of each of the  foregoing documents and the signature block for the ISDA Master Agreement (at  the bottom of the first page of the ISDA Master Agreement).
The full set of  signature documents comprises four pieces: (1)  [BOILERPLATE] ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency - Cross Border) (2)  Schedule to the Master Agreement [previously emailed to you] (3)  [BOILERPLATE] ISDA Credit Support Annex  [NOTE:  the document contains  12 paragraphs] (4)  Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex [previously emailed to you]  When we are ready to execute documents, we generally send out a complete  package with all four parts.
The two emails which you previously received  probably have the word "DRAFT" plastered all over them and we would normally  remove this wording.
Please call me in the morning so that we can be sure to  dot the "i's"  and cross the "t's".
Thanks.
Sara
