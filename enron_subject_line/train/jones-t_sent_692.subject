Attached please find referenced list.
The only amended counterparty with a  change was Murphy Exploration which was shut down for power.
I wonder, when  we are working with amended counterparties, if there is some way that my  prior approval could be on the recent spread sheet?
Right now I have to go  find the old spread sheet to find out what I approved it for last time to see  if I have any problem with the change.
So usually, unless I have - change  next to amended, it means I had no change to what I said before.
Does that  make sens?
