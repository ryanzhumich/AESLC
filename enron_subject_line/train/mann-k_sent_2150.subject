GE is asking for invoicing instructions for equipment currently in TP.
I  don't recall that being addressed in the documents they signed, and  I didn't  see an obvious answer in the documents I reviewed.
Any problem with Ben  receiving the invoices for now, then he can process through GF, etc?
Thanks,
