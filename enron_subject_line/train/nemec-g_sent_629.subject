Attached are redlined versions of an amended and restated LLC agreement and  an amendment to the Administrative Services Agreement.
I decided to simply  amend the Admin.
Agreement since the change was so minor.
You will note that  the changes in the LLC Agreement were solely to accommodate the revisions  made in the Capacity Allocation Agreement which I forwarded earlier.
Please  call if you have any questions.
