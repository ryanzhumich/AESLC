Debra: Susan Flynn mentioned that you might be able to help me out on getting some  Enron stuff for the kids that I teach Junior Achievement to at my son's  school.
I have been trying to contact someone that would be willing to give  this class some Enron freebies with no luck.
I think that Marge Nadasky was  the last person that my secretary talked to.
Do you know of anyone that can  help me out?
Carol
