Hi Tana,  A little birdie tells me that you  have a supply of the Energy & Power Risk  Management Glossary booklets.
Am I getting close?
I've found it to be very  helpful, and I think it would help one of our new lawyers, Carlos Sole.
Could I get a copy for him?
Any other good power references?
Thanks,
