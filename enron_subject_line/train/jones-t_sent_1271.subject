I just spoke to Mark Taylor and he has requested that we be more specific  about the nature of the project we are working on in our confidentiality  agreements.
On a going forward basis can you please provide that information  along with the other info you give me.
Thanks!
I will be out of the office Monday and Tuesday.
If you have a RUSH  Confidentiality Agreement that can't wait until Wednesday, call Mark Taylor  at x37459 and he will find someone else in our Group to prepare it.
Louise, don't worry about Continental.
Mark is working on getting it signed  in my absence!
