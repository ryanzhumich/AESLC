Lloyd,  I would like Ricardo and I to sit down with Kevin and go over how our PJM  load forecast model works.
I want to use it, or a version of it, for day to  day sensitivity analysis.
I haven't met Kevin yet so if you could mention  this to him I would appreciate it.
I would also like to sit down with you  some time this week to talk about PJM fundamentals and co-ordinating our  analytical efforts.
I want to get a feel for what we have done and set some  goals as to what needs to be done.
Let me know if one afternoon this week  works for you.
Thanx,
