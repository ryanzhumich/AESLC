Hey, AC!
How are things going for you?
Liking your new freedom, wild girl?
I hope  your having fun.
I'm sure missing you on Entex.
I'm already feeling the  heat from TM.
With the cold spell and the change in weather forecasts, I  have to re-evaluate Entex everyday.
But, that's the way it always is over  here.
I've been meaning to e-mail you, but I always remember after I leave  the office.
Anyway, let me know how it's going.
Later,  D
