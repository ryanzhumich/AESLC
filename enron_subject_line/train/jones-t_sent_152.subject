I still need to get the following prior guaranty returned to the  counterparty.
If you are not going to locate this, I need to know because I  am going to have to problem solve this with the counterparty.
1.
Guaranty dated as of February 10, 1998 by PG&E Corporation in favor of  Enron Power Marketing  (this would have covered physical power, not  financial).
I received the original PG&E Energy Trading Corporation guaranty in favor of  ECT Canada dated as of March 11, 1997 from the Calgary office, so that one is  taken care of.
