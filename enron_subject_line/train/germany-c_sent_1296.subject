You left 2 TRCO invoice questions on my desk.
1.
Contract 3.3558 - this is a volumetric release from PSNC for CES Retail.
The demand and commodity invoice come in together I believe.
2.
Contract 3.3509 - ???
I don't understand this one.
Take a look at  k#1.3473.
Did we receive a demand charge on 1.3473 and not have the demand  estimated in Sitara?
I may need to add 1.3473 and 0 3.3509.
Let me know  what you find.
