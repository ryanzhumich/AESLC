Good morning,  Just checking in.
Michael and I had a good morning.
No weird outfits  today.
Figures, since I now have a camera ready to go.
So what do you think about the stone thing?
I like the way Bob's front yard  looks.
I'm not sore today, but then again, I didn't do all that much.
Our yard is  looking better, though.
Hope you are having a good day.
Love,
