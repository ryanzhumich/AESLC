Here is the model that Delmarva sent to us, which needs to be run through a  WinZip file.
You may want to check it against the previous model they sent  to us to see what has changed.
I will be putting together questions on the  model they sent over.
Let me know when you would like to sit down and go  through them.
Bruce - you may want to go through it to check the O&M  assumptions.
Bruce, if you have any questions please give myself or Erin  Norris a call.
Thanks Ben
