Andrea Hauser w/EnronOnline called and said that Marathon has a problem with  the terms of the online GTC's (default language) for LPG, petrochems, and  refined products and would like to talk to one of our lawyers.
Marathon's  lawyer is Rhonda Stinemyer and her # is 713/296-2408.
Can you let Andrea  know who will be handling this.
Thanks.
