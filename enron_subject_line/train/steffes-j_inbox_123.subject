Dear Friends,   As has been my custom for the last several years since my moving from New Yorkto CaliforniaI am sending a message wishing each and every one of you and your families the Happiest and Healthiest of Holiday Seasons.
This year perhaps more than ever I have had the chance to think about how fortunate I have been to be able to send a greeting out to so many people with whom I have had the opportunity to work with and call my friends over the years.
From the old NYPP to ABB, APX and Enron, it has been my pleasure to have worked with you.
No matter where I have gone I have been lucky enough to met and work with some of the best people in the industry.
My hope for each of you is to have a prosperous New Year and that I have the opportunity to see you again as time moves forward.
Happy Holidays,

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year
