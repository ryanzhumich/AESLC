As of this week EnronOnline has just started offering US/Canadian Dollar  Swaps Online.
As part of my review in determining whether a counterparty can  transact these products online I look at the Financial Trading Agreement  Database to see if there are any restrictions indicated, check the master  swap agreement, and I am also looking at any Board Resolutions we might have  received when we got the master agreement executed.
What I am finding is that in the old days when we asked for resolutions  evidencing the authority to enter into the master agreement/derivative  transactions frequently the resolutions do not allow the counterparies to  enter into currency transactions.
Since transacting these currency  transactions with our energy customers is a new area of business for us I  just wanted us all to be mindful to check these old resolutions and not to  rely solely on the "Restrictions" contained in Lotus Notes.
