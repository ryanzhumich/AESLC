Further to our conversation, please see attachment regarding warranty and  netting.
Disregard the section on "Non-Warranted Gas" as this does not apply to our  negotiations.
Netting.
In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an  amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each  Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to  pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater  aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the  amounts owed.
Best regards,
