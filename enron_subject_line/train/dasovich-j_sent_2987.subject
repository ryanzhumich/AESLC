Mary Beth:    For what it's worth, I've read this, and if Laura Tyson or Larry Summers sign  it, I have serious concerns about the effect it would have on their ability  to play the role that we envision in moving our proposal forward  (understanding that our odds of success are somewhat meager).
While I don't  disagree with the language, it is strong and therefore very likely to make  the Governor and his staff very uncomfortable.
I would recommend that they  do not sign.
Best,
