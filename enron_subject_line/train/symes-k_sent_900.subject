I suppose my victory in this, our latest but not last competition, would be  IMPLIED.
Rather, I mean that my triumph could be INFERRED or even TACIT.
My  skill is UNDERSTOOD, my speed INSINUATED, and my nimble pairing of the two is  INTIMATED by the fact that I won this competition.
Now, I'll be sadly disappointed if you don't get this e-mail until later  today, being that you have such a confusing and multi-layered e-mail  situation, because I need for you to know that I got the answer first.
So for  the record, it is 8:45 a.m. on Monday.
A side note: I also have The Great  Gatsby in my possession.
