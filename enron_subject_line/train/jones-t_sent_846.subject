Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving the following  countries to the non-approved list:  Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech  Republic, Denmark, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, and Slovenia.
Below  is the list, now updated to reflect this change.
Jurisdictions which are are approved to trade credit derivatives:  Finland,  Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K, and the U.S..  Jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives include:   Austria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France,  Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Scotland, Singapore,  Slovenia, Spain, and The Netherlands.
For banks incorporated in a  non-approved jurisdiction, it may be possible for them to trade out of a  branch located in an approved jurisdiction (i.e.
U.S. and U.K. branches).
This would have to be determined on a case by case basis.
Please let me know if there are any changes to this list.
