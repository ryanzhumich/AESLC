Luanne: Our credit person is fine with revising the MAC language to say taht a MAC  would be triggered if either (1) an entity's Credit Support Provider's rating  from S&P is below BBB- by S&P or Baa3 by Moody's or (2) if such Credit  Support Provider fails to be rated by both S&P and Moody's.
Also, in  Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of the ISDA Schedule we would like to change the  reference to "Goldman Group" to "The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc."  I will have Tana Jones draft an amendment and send it to you.
Call me if  there are any problems with the above.
Tana, Please draft an amendment for my review.
