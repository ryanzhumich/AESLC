All 3 of the TCO schedulers are back today and Joanie said she will get me an  updated storage worksheet with the Choice information.
Also, Scott Goodell, Molly Johnson, Jeff Westover, and I are having lunch  with Don and Ernie today.
We will be giving them the Feb (and maybe some  March) invoices.
