They don't have the exclusive line (brand new) boat for our week but they do  have this one.
If you can get in the night before we can actually stay on  the boat and leave early in the morning - effectively getting an extra day of  sailing.
If you want to check it out online, their website is  www.moorings.com and the boat is a 463.
There's some good stuff on the site  for people who've never been before - Bill might find it comforting.
