In case anyone was wondering.....  RE: Tax Refunds   The amount of your payment is based on the taxable income shown on your  2000 return.
The amount is 5% of your taxable income up to a maximum of  $300 for a single taxpayer, $500 for head of household and $600 for a  married couple filing jointly.
If your tax liability after nonrefundable  credits is less than these maximum amounts, your limit is the smaller of  this amount or 5% of your taxable income.
If you did not have a tax  liability for 2000 but do have one for 2001, you may be able to claim the  tax credit on your 2001 return.
This means for those of you who made at least $6000 in taxable income  last year (2000), you will receive $300 back on the date scheduled below:       Receive your check by:           Last two digits of your SSN:   July 23            00-09  July 30            10-19  August 6            20-29  August 13            30-39  August 20            40-49  August 27            50-59  Sept 3            60-69  Sept 10            70-79  Sept 17            80-89  Sept 24            90-99             See you at the liquor store!
