I still have not released the 700 dth of capacity from VNG to Nabisco on  CGAS.
I just spoke with Henry Riewerts at Nabisco.
He does not have a  navigator ID and password.
This will be the only CGAS activity he has and he  has not bought any gas for Nov either.
I think he needs someone to handle  this for him.
Is this the type of thing we can pass on to EES?
