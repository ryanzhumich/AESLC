Dan,  I wanted to let you know that we are working on the problem that we are having with the straddle deals being booked into Tagg.
I also wanted to bring to your attention that these deals tested correctly in Tagg Stage, so we are trying to sort out what is happening in Production.
I am working with Tagg IT to resolve the issue.
I will keep you posted.
Thanks TARA
