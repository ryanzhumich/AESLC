Jeff,  Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy economics and finance in February of next year.
They would like very much to  have  you as a keynote speaker.
Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend that you speak at this conference.
I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn a few times about the program and  I think that this will be  an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and agenda for the future.
I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation.
Vince
