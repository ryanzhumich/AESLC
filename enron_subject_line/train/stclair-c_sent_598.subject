Scott, Bruce, Sam and John: Gaurav has informed me that the next draft of the ACE insurance policy will  be distributed by ACE sometime tomorrow.
What we would like to do is  schedule a time on Monday that we could talk with you about it with the hope  that we could have a discussion with ACE soon afterward.
Could you please  e-mail to me and Gaurav Babbar some times on Monday that work for you as a  group and we will get something set up.
Thanks.
Carol
