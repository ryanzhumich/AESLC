John, I just spoke with Dan Walker, Vice President  of Development for the  Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation about Enron's initiative for a corporation  partnership.
After we had discussed our interest and desire and what  opportunities are available with the Foundation for Enron, Dan stated that  will be visiting with the Foundation's CEO next week and one of the issues to  be discussed will be development of  an MOU or Agreement between Enron and  the RMEF.
Looks like things are beginning to progress.
Im having quite a bit of interest from some of the Houston based Enron  employees about how they can get involved.
Any suggestions on how I can  "advertise" opportunities within the Corporation for employee involvement  with the RMEF?
