As soon as I hit the "send" button I recalled another issue.
Enron does not  want the LLC used for anything other than the  acquistion/disposition/adminstration of the equipment.
Other development  activities should be conducted in another entity, at least so long as Enron  has an ownership interest.
I'm going to double check this, as it seems the  LOI is fairly specific on this point.
