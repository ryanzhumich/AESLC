Just wanted to let you know I haven't forgotten you.
All our traders and  schedulers have been in a meeting this afternoon, and as soon as they got out  the frenzy of trading and scheduling began again.
I'm going to give things a  minute to settle down, and then ask around as to how people would like their  Livelink training.
I'll get back to you soon.
Thanks,
