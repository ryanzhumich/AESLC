Since receiving your e:mail message last Monday on your needs in power, I  have spent three (!!!)
full days in PRC meetings since then.
I have shared  your needs with both Todd Hall and Kristin Albrecht (my power business  controller here in Houston) and have gotten their thoughts on how we could be  of help.
Sorry that I keep missing your calls.
I will be meeting with  Fernley, but I will also try to reach you by phone tomorrow.
