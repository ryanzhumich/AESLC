Just a quick note about the free agent and bye week replacements for this  year.
The free agent draft will be held Thursday at 1pm.
You will have  until 1pm to submit your free agent requests to me at mcuilla@enron.com.
You  should include who you want, who you want to drop and the amount of points  you want to bid.
You can bid 0 points for a free agent however if someone  bids 1 point you will lose.
In the case of a tying bid the two teams will  have an open bid to determine who gets the player.
Everyone will start with  100 points and you more points based on your weekly finish (1 point for  highest score and 12 points for lowest score).
