I just got off the phone with Aquila's Kansas City attorney about online  trading issues and he said he would like to get an ISDA Master in place with  us.
He said the contact to negotiate is their Calgary attorney, Carissa  Browning at (403) 543-7188.
I told him I would pass on the request to our  Credit team.
Much thanks!
