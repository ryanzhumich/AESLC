Susan: Sara and I would like to meet with you sometime on Monday to go over all  outstanding work items so we are aware of what can be accomplished before you  leave and what may need to be given to the other paralegals.
Can we do that  at 10 and can you send to us before then an updated list of your outstanding  work assignments?
Thanks.
Carol
