Bob:  Attached is a draft "forward template" for circulation by Enron Corp. to  potential counterparties.
I based the template on the Lehman Bros. forward  transaction (which I will fax to you separately).
Per our discussion, please  take a look at the template from Enron's viewpoint and suggest improvements,  comments, etc.
Enron Corp. has a potential counterparty in the wings and I  would like to send out the template tomorrowl  Please call me with your questions.
As always, thanks for your help.
Sara
