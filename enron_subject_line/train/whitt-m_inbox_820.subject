Good morning,  For those of you who don't know me I have taken Anne Bike's place as manager of the West risk desk.
I am in the process of loading the Natural Gas Prices reports your currently getting by e-mail onto a website.
Once this is ready you will be able to access this website daily to view these reports.
In order to grant you access I will need to get your NT login ID and your e-mail address.
Can you please reply with this information and any questions or concerns you may have.
Thanks
