In light of the recent PCB issue with PG&E on the Topock Lateral,  I have  asked Mr. John Woodyard of Roy F. Westin to c ome to Houston and make a   presentation on PCB's in natural gas pipelines.
Mr. Woodyard has  considerable experience in the management of PCB's and works closely in  industry associations (INGAA and GRI),  Mr. Woodyard also works as a  consultant in this capacity.
The date of this meeting will be on Friday, September 3rd, beginning at 9:00  am.
Lou Soldano will be setting up a meeting room and will notifiy all  attendees via lotus notes prior to the September 3rd meeting date.
I think this meeting will be very interesting and informative and and  encourage all to attend, if possible.
