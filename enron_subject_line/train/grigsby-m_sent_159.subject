The PG&E basis position in TDS does not match the FEB/MAR position.
The Baja  spread was executed as a NOV-MAR position months ago.
The only real changes  were to Socal basis over time.
There is no telling when this might have  changed in error.
Will you please research the position to see when this  position was reduced.
I am guessing that a park and loan was executed by  Frank Ermis at some point and the basis risk was allocated to GD New by  mistake.
Thanks,
