Jason, our new computer floortech, has discovered why we can't get into the  system.
He spoke to the Tradespark people and Tradespark is an NT system,  and they won't have Microsoft 2000 compatibility for several months.
We  cannot install NT on each of your individual computers, Jason says you can  only have one system at any given time, so I have asked him to locate an  unused terminal on the floor and install NT on that computer.
As soon as we  have it up and running, I will let you know and you will have to do your  review at that terminal.
Thanks for your patience.
