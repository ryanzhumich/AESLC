Thanks for your help.
I also left a message for Jeff because I was told that  he worked on the transaction.
The name "Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona" ("Stadacona") does not appear on  the corporate database so I cannot verify that it is an Enron-owned entity.
The only question is:  Can we book the FX trade in the names of Stadacona and  RMT?
