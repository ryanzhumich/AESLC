John: I have finally heard back from my credit person on all of the credit points  that I wanted him to confirm.
The only change that he raised was on the  cross default where he said that the threshold was $100,000,000 for the  Credit Support Providers and $10,000,000 for each party.
I will send you a  new mark up on that.
Otherwise, everything else credit wise was as stated in  your draft.
