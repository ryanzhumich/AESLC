Mark,  I reviewed the contracts for whether the gathering fees are charged on  an Mcf vs MMBtu basis.
The following are what the contracts state:  Beartooth - MMBtu Crescendo - Mcf D&G Roustabout - MMBtu Hallwood - MMBtu LoneMountain/Premier - MMBtu National Fuels - MMBtu Northstar - MMBtu Tom Brown - Based on their stated intent to renegotiate Trend- MMBtu Wasatch - Not stated in contract.
Rate is as Wildhorse adjusts from month to  month Venoco - MMBtu  Let me know if you have any questions.
