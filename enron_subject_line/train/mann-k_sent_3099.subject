Dear Mr. Keffer,  Thank you so much for agreeing to pass my resume along to the appropriate  person with the Astros organization.
In keeping with our family tradition, I  am a huge Astros fan, and would appreciate the opportunity to get a "behind  the scenes look" at how a professional sports organization works.
This should be an exciting season for Houston baseball, and it would be an  honor to be a part of it.
Any assistance you can give in putting me in touch  with the right person would be appreciated.
Sincerely,
