Sure Sue has filled you in, but just to be certain, my understanding is that  Dan Douglas, attorney for WPTF, is going to meet with the AG (not sure when)  in an attempt to narrow the scope of the subpoena.
Dan also plans to begin  drafting responses to the subpeona.
Since we are a member of WPTF and  therefore presumably covered by the subpoena, seems important that our  attorney's coordinate with Dan.
Sue, if I've mangled anything, let me know.
Best,
