Aurora, my changes appear on the attached.
I assume you or AA have updated the numbers for eligible transition costs  (second paragraph of section 7).
(If you have not, I'm really not sure who  would have those numbers) I updated the numbers for environmental costs in the footnotes.
Please call  (x30596) if you have any questions.
