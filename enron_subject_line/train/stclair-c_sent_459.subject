Susan: Could you please when you return on Monday circulate a list of issues that we  need to discuss regarding the forms?
Susan Flynn was keeping track of some  of those issues after you left.
I would like to try to get those issues  addressed next week with the people that we need to talk to so that we can  turn a draft of the ISDA Schedules, so please make this a priority.
Thanks.
