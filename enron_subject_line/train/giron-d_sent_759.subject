Stephanie,  We are breaking up our Central Midcon region into two books beginning July  1.
To facilitate this, Sitara has set up two new internal books:  ENA-IM Mid  Central South & ENA-IM Mid Central North.
It would be helpful if we could  have any physical June EOL deals continue to be booked to ENA-IM Central but  all physical July-out deals booked to the new books.
The two traders  involved are Kelli Stevens and Ed Smith.
Kelli Stevens ENA-IM Mid Central South  Ed Smith ENA-IM Mid Central North  Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do to expedite this  request.
Thanks for your help.
