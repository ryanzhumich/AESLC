Suzanne: Just saw the org chnages memo.
Seems like alot has been going on.
Would you  mind mailing the memo and charts to me?
For some reason, our computer does  not print out charts.
How are you doing?
I'm doing great although I wish we  knew who our next president is going to be.
I played tennis with Elizabeth  Sager yesterday.
She is really good and I hope we get to play more.
I'll  give you a call maybe later today or tomorrow.
Take care.
