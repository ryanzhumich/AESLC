For Dec, we were taking 4679 day from the Egan parking into TGT.
Effective  12/16/2000, we moved the remaining balance to Jan 2001.
I made the following  adjustments to deal 473190,   took daily withdrawal volumes to 0 effective 12/16 - 12/31  extended the deal to Jan 2001  changed 1/1/2001 to 2444  changed 1/2/2001 - 1/31/2001 to 2414  This might be a little confusing because we also have withdrawals of about  1500 day in Jan.  Also, Egan is showing a different balance than what I have.
I show we should have a total balance of 132,247 (4679 x (31-13)  plus  48025  )  at the end of gas day 12/13/2000.
Egan is showing a balance of 134,302.
This just means that we parked more gas than I thought or we cut back on some  of our withdrawals on the 1st through the 13th.
No big deal, I just want to  make sure we don't leave any gas in parking.
