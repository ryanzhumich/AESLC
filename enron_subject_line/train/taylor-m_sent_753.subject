I received the attachment you sent to me at Christmas but was not sure how  well it worked for you to recieve them.
I took a roll of film to be  developed and they had a special on having the photos returned on a disk as  well as prints.
I though they were the Christmas pictures that I could send  to you right away - but it turns out it was an old roll.
