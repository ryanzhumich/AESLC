Steve, I noticed that our allocation from 2000 to 2001 is going up by 21%  year on year (ie) $13.9M from $11.5M.
We have been able to keep ENA's direct  group expenses flat year on year, we are trying hard to keep the corporate  allocation flat year to year as well.
Do you have a view on how we might be  able to achieve this goal?
Regards
