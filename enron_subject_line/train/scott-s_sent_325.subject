Nancy, I've prepared the attached outline in response to FERC Staff's request  that we provide "something in writing."
This is basically just a description  of our proposal.
I've tried to keep it brief so that staff members are not  reading while we're trying to talk to them.
It should be enough information  to raise a lot of questions.
Please wait until Shelley or I give you the go-ahead to pass this along to  the relevant Commission people; I'd like to give the other addressees the  opportunity to comment on this to the extent possible.
Everyone else:  please give me your comments ASAP as Nancy has been asked to  provide something to them tomorrow.
