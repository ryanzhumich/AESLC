Susan and Samantha: This is a file that apparently Shari worked on and Susan Flynn gave to me.
I  have resolved the last tax issue and I will mark up the existing draft which  then should be ready to sign.
There are some Guaranty issues that I need to  take care of but in the meantime I will need one of you to revise the draft  and coordinate getting it signed by the counterparty.
