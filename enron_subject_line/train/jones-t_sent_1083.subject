What is going on with the revisions to the tax language in the ISDA?
I spoke  to Marie and she said that at year end the tax language out of "ISDAexh.doc  "was sent to Rhett Jackson for review and as far as she know it hadn't been  signed off on.
Obviously, we still have the old language in the form and we  need to get this updated.
