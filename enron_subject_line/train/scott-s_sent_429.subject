Lillian, please see the attached authorization memo.
It is still in draft  form, but since time is of the essence, Geneva advised me to forward it to  you now so that you could start working on it.
We would like to have the new  company formed today if possible.
I will let you know if I make any changes  to the attached.
In the meantime, please do not hesitate to call if you have  questions.
