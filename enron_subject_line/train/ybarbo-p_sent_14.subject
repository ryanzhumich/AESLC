Oscar,  Per our conversation, the following are the fuel management team's  assumptions of fuel requirements for Eco at 100% of capacity:  LNG   91,260 MMBtu/day at 507 MW    Heat Rate = 7500 BTU/kwh  LPG   1905 Metric Tons at 507 MW     Heat Rate = 7461 BTU/kwh    (Note: 522  gallons/MT   ,   91,300 Btu/gallon)  No.2   619,000 gallons/day at 465 MW   Heat Rate = 7313 BTU/kwh    (Note:  131,850 Btu/gallon)   Heat rates at less than 100% of capacity will be different from those at  100%.
Check with Rick or Arthur regarding performance curves.
Call me if you have any additional questions.
