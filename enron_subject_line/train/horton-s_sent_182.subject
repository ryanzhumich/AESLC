The game was awesome.
Our tickets were directly behind homeplate.
Debbie  said she could see me on every pitch and knew that I left the bootom half of  the 8th inning.
She said I never picked my nose once on camera.
Pretty  good, huh.
Have a good day.
Talk with you later.
By the way, your car is done.
They  had no problem removing the oil filter at all.
They only had to wriggle it a  little bit.
Love, Daddy
