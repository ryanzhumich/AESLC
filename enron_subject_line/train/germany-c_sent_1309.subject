I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point  person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.
CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon  citygates.
ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one  has a different BTU factor.
This causes CES to be long or short depending on  the conversion factor.
I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it  but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.
Comments?
