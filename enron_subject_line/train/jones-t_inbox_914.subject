Hi Tana,  I was just wondering if you could assist with the status of the following PA's.
I understand these are awaiting approval by Legal and Contracts, Houston, having already been approved by Credit, Sydney:  	Company			Name			Date Submitted NTT Communications		Taka Maeda		7 June 01 Yuen Foong Yu Paper		Yileng Tseng		10 Aug 01 Beijing Zhengcheung Technology	Mr. Hwzhao		17 Aug 01 Moraka Pte				Venkatesh Raman	13 Sept 01 Terragate Pty Ltd			Charlie Bell		12 Sep 01 Mitsui Mining Australia		Akihiro Imazawa		9 Oct 01 Coal & Allied Operations		Matthew Wall		6 Nov 01 Nipponkoa Insurance		Kenji Terauchi		6 Nov 01  As I am sure you can appreciate, I have had several inquiries regarding these applications.
With the exception of the last 2 which have only recently been entered, these PA's for the most part seem to be taking quite a long time.
Any information you can provide regarding the status of any of the above would be greatly appreciated  Thank you and regards,
