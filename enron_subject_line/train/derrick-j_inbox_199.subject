Jim Bouillion of CRM and Gary Cooney of McGriff, Seibels (our insurance broker) asked that I raise three matters with you: 1.
Scheduling of a meeting with the D & O carriers' counsel; 2.
Obtaining additional D & O coverage; and, 3.
Defense counsel selection in light of the possible "advise of counsel" defense and subrogation rights of the carriers.
I know that you are covered up, but I would not expect discussion of these issues to take more than 15 minutes.
I will wait to hear form you or Steph.
Thanks.
