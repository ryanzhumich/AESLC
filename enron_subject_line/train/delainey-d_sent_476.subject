Richard, I think I am starting to obsess and I really don't want you guys  working on this; however, it think that it is very odd that this Griffin guy  over an eight week process, two registered letters and a phone conversation  does not send a letter or bring up this "Chrome Dreams" issue from 1986 with  us until this lawsuit is filed without our knowledge.
This guys sounds a little off.
Regards
