Upon consultation with various members of the Swap Group, I am having Taffy  make dinner reservations for 7:00 pm at La Fogata in San Antonio for 14  people on Wednesday night.
This is not obligatory, so if you have other  dinner plans, please do not feel under any pressure to join us, just let me  know.
Of course, if any one comes up with a better place, I'm open to  suggestions..., but at least we'll have something!
