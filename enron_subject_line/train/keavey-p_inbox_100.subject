To all:  Kathy and I would like to extend our warmest thanks for the stroller/carseat (infant SUV) everyone gave us on Tuesday.
Kathy was dissapointed she could not be here, as she has been ordered bedrest by the OBGyn nazi.
She looks forward to meeting all of you soon.
Again, we really appreciate the gift and will use it everyday.
Thank you,
