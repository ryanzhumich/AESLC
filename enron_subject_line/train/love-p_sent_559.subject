Do you know the names of some good jazz clubs in Chicago?
I figure you spend  so much time there you can reccomend a few to me.
I have a coworker going up  there next month and it is their first time to chicago.
I gave them Etta  James Place to go on rush and on the south side.
Can you think of any  other?
Thanks.
