Hi Steve,  I wanted to send this to you before I send it out to others, since I feel  like there were changes we had discussed that somehow didn't make in the last  draft.
Guess you can say this is a sanity check!
If it looks good to you,  then I will send it out, unless you prefer to make distribution.
