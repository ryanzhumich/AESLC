Hi John,  I believe Ben Jacoby has mentioned our deal with NorthWestern.
In connection  with that transaction, we have prepared the attached assignment and consent,  which is patterned after the Pastoria form.
We would like to get it wrapped  up in the next two weeks, if possible.
Please let Ben or me know if you have any questions.
