I am hoping to have Lotus Notes available to you in about two weeks.
The  initial view will include Master Swap Agreements and I am working on "Other  Agreements" which will include brokerage and repos.
On a slightly different  note, do you think we should schedule a regular [weekly] meeting to review  work in progress, issues, products, etc.?
If so, who should be included?
Thanks.
Sara
