Bill, attached is a memo prepared by Susan Scott that does a good job of  answering the several questions that you had about the situation at Topock.
Note that in Susan's first answer, PG&E has no obligation to Transwestern to  accept gas at Topock.
They may well have obligations to their own  transportation customers or sales customers that have to be satisfied with  Topock receipts, but that doesn't give TW any rights against PG&E.
I realize  these are not comforting answers, but I wanted us all to have a realistic  understanding of where we are.
I'm running this by Lou in case he has a  different spin on the history or the agreements.
Thanks.
DF
