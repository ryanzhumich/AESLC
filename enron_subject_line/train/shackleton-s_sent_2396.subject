I am finalizing the negotiation of the ISDA Master Agreement with SITA.
You  will recall that this is an ECTRIC; master NOT ENA.
SITA has (1) requested  evidence of EEFT's ability to sign for ECTRIC and (2) confirmation that "EEFT  is signing on the basis of their authority under the investment services  directive".
Would you please provide directly to SITA's lawyers as follows:  Susan Hopkinson and Sharon Lewis at Lovells in Paris:  susan.hopkinson@lovells.com
