Robert, I changed the volumes on the CES buy/sale deals 204462 and 204471.
I  just entered a volume for the last day of the month.
You don't need to do  this right away, when you get a chance go into Unify for Feb and show an  actual volume of 0 for the 25th - 28th and a volume of 991014 for the 28th.
Then retrack and balance.
Jeff, I will include these deals on my manual billing worksheet to you.
You  should be able to apply the payments to these deals.
