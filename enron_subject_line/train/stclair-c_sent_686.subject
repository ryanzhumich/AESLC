Tanya: This coming Friday Sara and I are going to walk the legal assistants through  some basic concepts with respect to the ISDA and CSA Schedules and  confirmations.
Do you think that we should invite some of the newer credit  people to this and if so, who?
Some of this will be a repeat of what we did  a few weeks ago but at a more basic level.
We were thinking that it may be  beneficial for Nidia Mendoza and Cathy Tudon.
Let me know what you think.
