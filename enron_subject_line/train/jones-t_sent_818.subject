Attached please find the referenced lists.
Please note:  Tampa Electric Company can do power sells only.
Even though Peoples Gas is a  division of Tampa Electric, it cannot trade power because its power marketing  license was not granted in that name.
Further, I earlier shut down Tampa  Electric Company for financial trading, and I am now opening them up for  financial trading, either as Tampa Electric or Peoples Gas.
