Leslie-  We will cashout the imbalance with the two Koch entities in the following way:  We owe Koch 11,885 mmbtu at $3.90/mmbtu, which equals $46,351.50.
Koch owes us 13,639 mmbtu at $2.21/mmbtu and 11,720 mmbtu at $2.38/mmbtu,  which equals $58,035.79.
The net of these imbalances is $11,684.29 due to Enron.
Let me know if you have any questions.
I negotiated this with Scott Garrison  at Koch.
Thanks,
