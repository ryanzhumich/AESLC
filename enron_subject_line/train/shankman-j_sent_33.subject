I met with Carlo (as did several other Enron employees) last week and we are  talking to them about a number of ideas.
One of which is detailed below  (from them) and has technology and paper/lubmer points.
I believe Carlo from  Dow will be calling you guys shortly.
Take a look at the attachment and  you'll understand the points he's making that are relevant to your  businesses.
