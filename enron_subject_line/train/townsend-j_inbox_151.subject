In September, ENA agreed to purchase capacity from New Power on Transco.
The total demand charge should have been $9,000.00 on contract 4.0159.
New Power released the capacity volumetrically and I didn't catch it.
The actual demand charge billed was $270,000.00.
New Power agreed to reimburse ENA for the difference of $261,000.00.
ENA will pay the pipeline the billed demand charge of $270,000.00 and bill New Power $261,000.00 on deal 1110019.
