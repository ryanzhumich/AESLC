Kali Pereira was not able to make the lesson on Sunday the 21st due to car  trouble.
By my calculations, she has taken 3 private lessons since and  including Dec 31, leaving an $89 balance of the $170.
That would allow for 3  additional private lessons.
What days and times will work over the next few  weeks?
Saturdays and Sundays will work depending on the time.
After school  during the week might work, with the exception of Mondays.
Thanks,
