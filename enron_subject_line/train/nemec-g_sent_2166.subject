Andrew,  Attached is a rough draft of the CSA.
I am still reviewing the  version, but it is substantially correct.
In the interest of time I am  forwarding this for your review.
Please note Section 3.4.
I am a little  concerned about this section from a retail wheeling standpoint.
I am trying  to find local counsel in Pa to review this section.
Please review and lets  discuss.
