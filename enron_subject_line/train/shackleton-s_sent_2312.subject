Hey, guys:  I'm negotiating a rush ISDA for ECTRIC under the law of England  and Wales.
I believe that Michael drafted originally.
(1)  submission to English courts and waiver of all objections  (2)  setoff  for all events (excluding affiliates) except for Tax Event or  Tax Event Upon Merger  Are the foregoing acceptable for ECTRIC?
Your immediate response is appreciated as Michael Moulton wants to book deal  Tuesday,  Nov. 7.
Thanks.
Sara
