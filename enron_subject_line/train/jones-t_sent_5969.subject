We are trying to track down the signed documents for this counterparty.
Our  notes reflect that Samantha Boyd sent them up to Peter for execution on  3/9/01 with instructions to send them back to Samantha Boyd when executed.
My understanding is that they were signed in Canada and returned to Samantha,  but they have not yet shown up here.
If you sent them fedex and can track  them via a tracking number can you see if you can find them.
They appear to  have done some unauthorized trades w/o having the master signed and this has  now become a really high priority.
Thanks!
