Attached is the referenced list.
Some comments:  We got a master financial  agreement in place with Calpine Power Services  Company so it has been opened  up to trade all financial.
Also, we replaced the old style "ERMS Master"  with an ISDA, so I am opening TXU Energy Trading Company for all financial  products as well.
For Trammo Gas, we got a letter from them a while back, reflecting under  what  names they can do financial trading under (I sent you all an email  about this about a month to two months ago).
That letter had the  counterparty styled "Transammonia, Inc. acting through its  Trammo Gas  Division".
I believe I already siad they could trade financial under that  name.
Let's just be consistent about how we deal with these divisions...
