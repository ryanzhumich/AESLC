D-Rock,  Attached are a clean and redlined copy with my comments.
I have  noted a couple of areas where I still have questions.
One that I didn't note in the agreement, is my concern that they could deny  us a new Delivery Point if we can't agree on terms.
We need to discuss this  one tommorrow.
I will shout out at ya tommorrow.
