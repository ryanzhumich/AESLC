Pat:  I've  finished reviewing the confirms and am missing the following FX  confirmations:  (1)  National Bank of Canada  4/25/01 maturity  (2)  Comerica   4/17/01 maturity  (2)  Scotia Bank   maturities for 5/8/01, 6/8/01, 7/8/01 and 8/8/01  Also, if you have added more transactions beyond your January 31, 2001  summary, we would like copies.
Other than with respect to the two Forward Extras with Bank of America, are  there any restrictions in your credit agreements with the various banks that  require notice and/or consent (with respect to forward positions) when there  is a change of ownership, etc.
(as to Daishowa)?
