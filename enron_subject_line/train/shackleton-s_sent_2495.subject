Jim:  I was hoping that we could speak sometime today as I will be out of the  office Dec. 7 and 8.
I would like to discuss your comments the Schedule and  receive your blackline to the Credit Support Annex.
I am available all day  except between the hours of 10 am - 2 pm (Houston time).
I look forward to  hearing from you.
Regards.
Sara
