Will,   Here is a list of the top items we need to work on to improve the position  and p&l reporting for the west desk.
My underlying goal is to create position managers and p&l reports that  represent all the risk held by the desk and estimate p&l with great accuracy.
Let's try and schedule a meeting for this Wednesday to go over the items  above.
Phillip
