Attached is the First Amendment to License Agreement which extends the term  of the contract to March 31, 2001.
My understanding is that you will be  sending it directly to FT.  Once they have signed off on the form, let  me  know and I will get Mark Greenberg to initial it and get it signed by an  officer of EnronOnline.
Call me at x33399 if you have any questions or if I  can be of further assistance.
