Attached is the referenced counterparty approval list.
Per earlier emails,  no U.S. counterparty should be approved for european power until we hear  otherwise.
Also, per my email yesterday, CMS Marketing, Services & Trading Company was  already approved yesterday to do basis financial.
All other prior approvals  for that counterparty should stay the same.
