Hi Paul,  I've been reviewing the draft facilities agreement, which is now getting to  be a hot topic.
One thing to keep in mind is that we would really prefer  that the facility agreements not refer to the May 12 agreement, if this is  possible.
Could you please give this some thought and review the document  with this in mind?
I look forward to discussing this with you soon.
Thanks,
