Mark:  In connection with Susan F.'s departure, could you please provide a  copy of her "project list" so that we can follow up on  finalizing/redistributing her workload?
I have lots of questions which I'm  sure can't be answered this minute, such as:  Shouldn't we help to prioritize  her work?
Will she continue day-to-day work?
Who will take confirm desk  calls?, How will this impact Samantha's training (maybe the lawyers should be  involved now), etc.
Please let us know when you'd like to "regroup".
Thanks.
Sara
