We need to break out our Midcon region into two separate books starting with  July production.
We did this with the Market region a couple of months ago.
If possible, I would like to use these two names:   ENA-IM Mid Central South  ENA-IM Mid Central North  Please let me know what needs to be done in order to expedite this request.
Thanks.
