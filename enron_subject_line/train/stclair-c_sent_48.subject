Tana: I have asked Suzanne to reserve the following dates for the big conference  room on 30 for our upcoming lunch seminars:  Friday, May 5th, Thursday, May  25th and Friday, June 16th.
Sara and I are going to try and set something up  with the weather group for the May 5th date if that works for them.
Can we  plan on scheduleing something with the confirms group and the global  contracts group for the other 2 dates?
Sara and I need to talk about what to  do with the credit group.
