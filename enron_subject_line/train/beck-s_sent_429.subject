Scott Earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had  earlier today with Jeff Shankman and Vince Kaminiski that Jeff announced that  he had gotten the nod from Mark Frevert to manage the LNG book of business.
(This sentence structure is bad, but you get the drift.)
That is probably  what Shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility.
I will  assume that is in addition to gas, but I don't know that for sure.
Scott has been working on setting up the risk books for LNG, working closely  over the last several weeks with Vince Kaminski.
We need to talk about this  business and the best way to support it.
Have you had any conversations with  Jeff on this?
