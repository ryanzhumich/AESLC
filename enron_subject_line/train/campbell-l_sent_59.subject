The Title V air permit for C/S No.
4 has been issued.
There are some  requirements and conditions under this permit that the team should be aware  of and will be required to comply with.
I would like to visit with the team  at their safety meeting in June or july to go over the conditions of the  permit.
Please give the the dates in June and July when your next safety  meeting is.
This Title V presentation should last about 3 hours.
Thanx
