ED:  EWEB has requested a blackline of the ISDA and is ready to sign next week.
Your MAC references the "Electric System" which is defined in the Bond  Indenture which I sent to you earlier today.
It looks to me like the  Electric System includes physical and intangible assets acquired by the Board  as a separate utility system, including generating and transmission  facilities and the Trojan Project (not sure what this is).
I've asked  Stephanie to revise our docs to incorporate these definitions.
Please review  the CSA when Stephanie sends it to you (and comment) and I can send first  thing on Tuesday.
Thanks.
Sara  Stephanie:  Please send Ed a copy of the blacklined CSA when you are done.
