It is critical to our nation's energy future  to achieve robust competition  in wholesale power markets in order to ensure that electricity can move most   effectively from where it is produced to where it is most needed.
To that  end, this Administration will strongly encourage the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission( FERC)  to actively exercise jurisdiction over all  aspects of electricity transmission in interstate commerce and place all uses  of the grid under the same rates, terms, and conditions.
This jurisdiction  must also be extended by Congress to cover non-FERC jurisdictional power  authorities.
