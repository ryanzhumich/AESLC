FINANCIAL:  We have an ISDA Master in place, originally through Transammonia, Inc.,  acting through its division Trammochem.
That master has since been expanded  to allow trading through additional divisions, Trammo Gas Division and Trammo  Gas & Petrochemicals Division.
All trades and confirms can be done as  follows:  Transammonia, Inc. Transammonia, Inc. acting though its division Trammochem Transammonia Inc. acting through its Trammo Gas Division Transammonia Inc., acting through its Trammo Gas & Petrochemicals Division  Obviously, Transammonia, Inc., the body corporate, needs to always be on the  confirm.
PHYSICAL:  My reports from the other Legal trading groups are that they have no  contracts in place, although it is somewhat unclear on the physical gas side  as to whether Global Contracts as to whether we have any physical gas master  in place.
