What's the scoop on the TXU negotiation?
Brant says we're in a strong  negotiation position with them right now, because they've acquired Howard's  book and need our consent, and also have to post an expensive LC with us to  take in those Howard trades.
He wants to know if he should use our leverage  here to get that ISDA Master in place.
