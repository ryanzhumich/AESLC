I lost the information concerning fly fishing you left on my voice mail.
Could you be so kind as to resend via email.
I am thinking of just taking a  poll to see what everyone's interest are.
I personally am thinking Mountain  Biking sounds like great fun and a super way to endanger my life.
Drop me a  note when you get a chance.
Also what is the schedule for the get together  on Sat.
