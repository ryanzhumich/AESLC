Take a look at this.
Note that this does not address capacity release issues.
I think that might be too much for this letter.
I think we should take that up separately.
Probably, an ad hoc basis is best to start with.
For example, I think we should work with Marc of FPU on an individual basis and see what happens.
Then we would be able to feel more confident on whether to call a meeting on this or not.
