John,  The new products have been built and are in the process of being mapped to  Sitara and Tagg.
I'm working with Melba Lozano (EOL contact) and she tells  me they should be ready tomorrow.
Mark Taylor and I haven't spoken yet about simplifying the language in the  product long description, so I'll try to get with him tomorrow.
For now,  we're staying with the existing language which isn't really that bad.
Any of these products which are intra-month will stay in the swap filter as  US GAS DAILY products, but longer than intra-month will be in the basis  filter as US GAS BASIS products with the format:    US GAS BASIS      GD/D SoCal - HHub  The only product that will be different is the Nymex to daily swap which will  be:    US GAS BASIS      NXL1 - GD/D HHub  Any questions or comments,  Fletch x3-6219
