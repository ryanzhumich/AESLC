I decided I needed the book we discussed so I went online to Amazon.com  and ordered it!
While there I found references to a number of books I  tought you might be interested in:  the Hornblower series by C.S.
Forester the Bolitho stories from Alexander Kent the Drinkwater series from Richard Woodman (e.g., "An Eye of the Fleet") the Ramage series from Dudley Pope Revolution at Sea Trilogy/James L. Nelson Lobscouse & Spotted Dog : Which It's a Gastronomic Companion to the                      Aubrey/Maturin Novels                       by Anne Chotzinoff Grossman, Lisa Grossman Thomas
