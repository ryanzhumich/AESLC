I've attached the EES March Dailies spreadsheet.
It should reflect the latest  volumes and hopefully will clear up some of the discrepancies we're seeing  between EES and EPMI.
Also, I've autoscheduled the following deals in an  attempt to feed them through to the CARP report.
Please let me know if you  see the changes come through, Mark.
The autoscheduled deals are:  533090 - 3/1/01-3/31/01 535419 - 3/2/01 535420 - 3/2/01 566081 - 3/1/01-3/31/01 550208 - 3/15/01    The last deal I'm checking on is #535568 - in your spreadsheet you said EES  saw the on peak hours totalling 1070.75 MWH and believed the on peak hours  should actually total 1016.75 MWH.
Below are the volumes I see both in the  EnPower deal and in the March Dailies spreadsheet.
