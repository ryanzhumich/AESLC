Susan and Susan: In an effort to better manage your work flows, Sara and I would like to meet  with you for about 30 minutes this week to get an idea of what's on your  plate and what we can do to ease the work load.
Could you please give this  some thought and let Taffy know when you want to meet so she can get it set  up?
Thanks.
Carol
