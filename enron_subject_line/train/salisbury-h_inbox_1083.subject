Due to the flooding, electrical and communications problems in Houston over the weekend, several Enron Information Technology systems experienced outages.
At this time all critical systems have been restored and should be operational.
In the process of restoring service, several user and common data directories had to be restored from the backup tapes from Thursday evening.
Therefore, some of you may be missing data files on your H drive or M drive that you created or modified on Friday.
If you have any questions or have any IT related problems, please contact the Resolution Center at x31411 for assistance.
