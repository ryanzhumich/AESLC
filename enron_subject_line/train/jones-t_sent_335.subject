I have been trying to get Brent Hendry and Andrea Calo (attorneys in our  Buenos Aires office) access to the Houston Legal Department's Lotus Notes  Master Swap Agreement database.
I understand that you are the person that  can get them access.
This will continue to be an issue as we expand our  trading offices around the world.
Can you let me, Mark Taylor, the Assistant  General Counsel for trading, and Brent know what we need to do to get Brent  and Andrea access.
Also, Brent wants to copy our Master Swap Agreement Database to create a  database for the Buenos Aires legal contracts.
How does Brent go about  getting this new database created?
Thanks for your help!
