Hi Mark,  I know we spoke about some of these things yesterday, but I thought I'd give you some specifics of the things we would look.
Many of these topics may be tied into the "Accounting, Administration" portion of the Word document you sent out.
Finance  - Loan documents* related to the debt financing of the project (especially any covenants or provisions in regard to the transferability of the debt under new ownership) *If the debt is not specifically tied to this project, then it would be valuable to know what percentage of corporate debt they have allocated to the project.
- Book Value of the Assets   - CapEx budget going forward (I saw that you already mentioned the need for historical CapEx numbers.)
- Depreciation Schedule of Assets  These are the issues that would be most important to us given all the other subjects that you have already address in your list.
Thanks,
