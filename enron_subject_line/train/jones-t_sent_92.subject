Mark said you would know who it is in London that prepared a "script" for  your traders on what to say on the phone when transacting a deal.
Liz Sager  is working on some training mid-next week for the power desk traders and  needs to prepare a similar script for them.
If you could let me know who to  contact I'd appreciate it.
Thanks for your help!
