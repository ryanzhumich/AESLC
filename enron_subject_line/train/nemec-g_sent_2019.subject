You had asked for more information regarding Canadian renewal rights.
I found  language in tariff in Transcanada's website (www.transcanada..com) under the  following:  NOVA FTS-R, Sec 12, FTS-D, Sec 10 BC system, Sec 4.9  Bottom line: 12 month notice prior to end of term.
Once notice given,  irrevocable!
Must extend for at least one year.
Please call if you have questions.
