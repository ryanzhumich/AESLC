Hello,  I am an attorney at Enron North America Corp.
I have recently been  asked to coordinate our hiring of summer clerks.
Monica Jordan previously  had handled these duties and informed me that she had used the HBA Minority  Committee through which to do some of our hiring of clerks.
I am looking for information concerning this program; such as how it  operates, when it meets.
etc.
Any information you could supply would be  greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
