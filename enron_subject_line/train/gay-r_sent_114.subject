We just had a call with Novak, Barquin (V&E) and Tozzini on options for next  Monday such as economic equilibrium, arbitration, litigation etc.
We will be  putting all the results together for you by Friday Morning.
In the mean  time, it may be helpful for you to reflect on the following (particularly the  table).
This is really starting to bring it into focus for me.
We will try  to do the same for our options on Monday's decision.
