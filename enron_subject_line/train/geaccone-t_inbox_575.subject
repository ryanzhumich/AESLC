How does this look?
Also, I did change some numbers in the excel spreadsheet:  	The Ignacio to Blanco subscription levels were pulling from the row excluding ROFR capacity in the supporting sheet.
I changed it to be consistent with the other 	capacities (which include ROFR capacity).
Shelley had made some assumptions about East of Thoreau capacity subscription, such as, the USGT 400,000/d contract would remain subscribed (it doesn't 	have ROFR) and she had included the extension of 2-3 other contracts that don't have ROFR.
These contracts were then dropped after 2005.
I continued the 	extensions through 2006.
I changed the East of Thoreau capacity to 750,000/d from 850,000/d.
