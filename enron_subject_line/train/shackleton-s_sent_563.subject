AFAC and Marcelo:  We are in the process of reviewing the Comparative Chart  and attached memorandum and will soon provide a list of remaining issues  which Enron North America and South America would like to have addressed.
We  are also attempting to identify specific types of transactions which may be  required to hedge Enron risk in Brazil before 12/31/99.
For planning  purposes, the "group" would like to meet with you in Sao Paulo during the  week of November 28.
We are hoping that you may be able to accomodate us  on  November 30 (Tuesday), December 1 (Wednesday) or December 2 (Thursday).
Please let us hear from you.
Regards.
Sara
