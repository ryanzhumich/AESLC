Greetings Professor:  Our group consists of Jeff Dasovich, Mark Guinney, Anil Sama and Carolyn  Vavrek.
We propose to examine the recently failed acquisition by Coke of Quaker  Oats:  Why merge?
What was the value?
Upside?
Downside?
Why did it go  bust?
Should it have gone through?
What's up with this Buffet guy, anyway?
If you have any concerns with this proposal, please let us know.
Finally, if possible, we'd like to present on Thursday, April 26th.
Best,
