John,  I am performing code updates to the stand-alone EOL workstation WNAEOL-48101 this evening and wanted to check with you to see at which point it would be convenient for you.
I assume after the business day would be acceptable and my intent is to start near 6:00 p.m. or, at any time you decide is convenient for you.
I called a short while ago and will do so again before proceeding, but if you receive this email and need to contact me, you may reach me at extension 5-7004.
Thanks.
Chris Jeska Terminal Server Operations.
