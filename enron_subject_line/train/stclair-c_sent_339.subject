Mark: Enclosed is a revised draft of the Domain Transfer Agreement with my comments  and questions inserted.
Please call when convenient to discuss.
Have you  heard from Mark Palmer yet?
Alos, Mark Haedicke asked me to let John  Lavorato know that we were entering into this Agreement and I will leave him  with a voice mail today.
Carol    Michael: Do you have any comments?
Also, are you okay with NY law and should we add  an arbitration provision?
