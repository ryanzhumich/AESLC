Barbara,  I called Vlady Gorny and explained that the presentation by Jorion is not  offered under the umbrella of the  seminar sponsored by Enron and that it is a  closed meeting for the School faculty.
I don't think that Enron would open its job interviews to Rice observers who expressed interest and I made this comment to Vlady.
He is OK with this.
You can let his program director know that I have explained   to Vlady that it is a meeting for limited audience and that he does not expect to be  invited.
Please, let me know the details of the dinners.
Vince
