With respect to the trade done today with Gases y Graneles Liquidos S.A.,  please find attached a Chilean Annex A for an Omnibus form of confirmation.
Please attach this form and make an election for NY law as the choice of  law.
Along with the fax of the Confirmation to the Counterparty, please also  fax a form of IRS Form W-8BEN and ask the Counterparty to complete the form  and return it to us.
Craig, can you talk to the Counterparty and make sure  they send us back the tax form?
