Greetings Professor:  I'm in charge of managing our collective responses to this week's case and  have been called out of town on business at the last minute.
As a result,  if I make it to class at all tomorrow, I unfortunately won't make it until  after the break.
While I think one of my teammates will bring a hard copy to  class tomorrow, I wanted to plan for any mix-ups (contingencies?)
by emailing  a copy as well.
Best,
