Andrea,  The firm commitments I have so far are for the potatoes and pork chops.
That  red pepper dip looks really good, I may make that.
Do you want to choose  another one.
We're still waiting to hear back from some people, so I may  have to adjust the amount depending on how things go.
Let me know your  choice!
