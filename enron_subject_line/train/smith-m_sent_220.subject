Phillip,  Here's a copy of the spreadsheet we gave to Bill Bradford.
Our exposure  on  the financial deals increased relative to the february spreadsheet from $45  mil to $71.
Also, we have one physical deal (next winter), which is not  physical storage, that is marked at $12 mil.
The spreadsheet shows five  synthetic storage deals with PGE Energy Trading that may have the wrong  counterparty in our system.
I'm at the office and will be here through the  meeting.
My cell number is 832-444-7702 if you have any questions.
