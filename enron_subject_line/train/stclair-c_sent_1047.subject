Sara and Mary: Could we get together for lunch sometime soon so you can update me on what  has been happening at the office?
Let me know which dates work best for you  in the next few weeks.
My mother in law is coming for a visit next week so  can we shoot for sometime the week of November 6th?
Look forward to hearing  from you.
Charles is doing great.
Growing like a weed and becoming more  interactive with us.
While I miss the office routine, I am really enjoying  my time away from the office.
