I spoke with Ken Jacobs, with the Forest Service in Flagstaff, concerning his  agencies approval for the turbine construction at Station 2.
As a condition  of the approval from his agency, he has requested that all the ponderosa pine  trees to be removed for the turbine construction activities be flagged for  identification.
After the trees have been marked, we are to then contact him  so that he can visit the site and make an evaluation as to whether the Forest  Service will charge us for the tree removal or whether no additional charges  will be incurred as a result of the construction activity.
The charges will  depend upon the calculation of how many board feet of lumber there are in the  trees which are flagged.
As this activity is included in the time line for completion of all permits  and approvals, please contact me when the trees have been tagged and flagged  and I will contact Ken Jacobs so that he can make a site visit.
