Dan and I spoke with Jim Eckert at Tenn - VNG is his customer.
Following are  the MDQ's and rates on the Tennessee contracts effective 11/1/2000   Contract MDQ  Delivery Point Demand Comm  Comment 47  16,373  S Webster $6.0800  $.0500  Demand is $6.08 for daily volumes  below 4,723 per day.
Demand goes to $7.61 for daily volumes above 4,723 per day.
21881  4,599  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below  21882  518  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below   Comments: If we flow to any points other than the primary delivery point, the demand  charge goes to max rate which is about $9.80.
Questions for Tennessee; What are the rates for October?
Do the differences in demand and commodity apply to daily quantities or  monthly quantities?
