Per my conversations with Tom and Frank, unless Credit specifically tells us  that a counterparty is a credit derivatives counterparty, the online team  should consider that all U.S. based counterparties are not approved to trade  credit derivatives.
Credit will, in the same box where they put "declined" ,  "amended" or "division", put a note that says "credit derivatives" and in  those circumstances only you should consider that I will be indicating  whether or not the counterparty is approved to trade credit derivatives.
Otherwise, I will not be putting an "X" in the box for each and every  counterparty to say they can't trade credit derivatives.
I hope this makes sense to you, call me if it doesn't.
