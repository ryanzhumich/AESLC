Team Vitro:  I wanted to run these changes by you before sending them to Jeff Smith.
Jeff S. has lobbied for deleting the language on assignment, and state that  assignment of the consolidation agreement will be subject to the same terms,  etc.
as the other 2 contracts.
He also provide alternative language which  appears to be close to what was in the previous draft.
Since I didn't know  the genesis of the language in the consolidation agreement, so I thought I  would check with you first.
I eliminated 5 (a) because the contracts allow for partial termination.
