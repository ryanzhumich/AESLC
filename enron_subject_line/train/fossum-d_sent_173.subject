Please find out what you can about which issues FERC is interested in on the  Gallup rehearing requests.
I.e., did they issue the tolling order because of  our rehearing arguments on the confidentiality issue or SoCal's on the rate  discrimination issues?
Anything you learn would be helpful, but this info is  not so important that risks should be taken to get it.
Thanks.
DF.
