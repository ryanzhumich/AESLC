Dear Mr. Skilling:  I write on behalf of Jerry Murdock, who is currently in Europe.
Mr. Murdock asked me to pass on the following information regarding your telephone call scheduled for 10:00am (CST) on Tuesday, May 15.
Insight Capital hosts a quarterly dinner with Robert Rubin and Steve Friedman and other selected guests.
Our next dinner is scheduled for July 19 and will be held in Aspen, Colorado.
The Current State of the Global Market will be one of the topics under discussion and Jack Welch of GE is one of your fellow invitees.
The purpose of your conversation with Mr. Murdock is to discuss the above in more detail and to more fully brief you on the purpose of these dinners.
