Mark Taylor asked me to run something on Online Trading by you.
We got a  list of questions on various Online Trading issues from the Products Control  Group which appears to be the group the will be managing the Online Trading  HelpDesk.
One of their questions related to the desire of HelpDesk managers  to periodically listen in on phone calls with the customer to ensure what  they explained as a "quality control" over the responses given to customers  on the HelpDesk.
They explained it as being like when your credit card  company has an announcement that says the calls may be monitored from time to  time.
Is this something we want to do?
If we do, that brings up other issues, and  we will have to run this by our outside counsel, Sullivan & Cromwell.
Can you let me know your thoughts...Thanks!
