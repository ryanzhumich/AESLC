I received a call late today from the CPUC (Joyce @ 415-703-2199).
Someone from Pac Tel called and said that his service was switched without authorization - Mike Benson with Payphone group @707-253-8892 or 707-292-1766.
Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?
Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?
We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.
Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.
