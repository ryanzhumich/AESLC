All:  Attached are the two (2) final version GTC's.
The legal terminology is  identical for each product.
However, Stuart needs to provide a title for  each product which will also appear in the Paragraph 1.
The former Paragraph 2 has been deleted (it contained the "confirmation  terms") and the remaining paragraphs renumbered.
Justin:  Will you circulate the revised long description (since your  conversation with Stuart yesterday afternoon)?
Also, will you let us all  know when we are competely done?
Please call with comments as soon as possible.
