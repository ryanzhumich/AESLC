Ed:  CA has responded with the following comments:  (1)  Additional Event of Default - CA will accept if minimum ratings are set  at BBB- or Baa3.
(2)  Financials -  no Cargill entities provide quarterly financials as a  matter of practice.
(3)  Setoff - will not agree to our usual affiliate setoff language but will  agree to setoff under the ISDA  or other agreements.
CA has not accepted our cross default threshold language or guaranty pending  a determination from their credit group.
Please let me know your response.
Thanks.
SS
