I will be attending an Energy Math training session today from 9 a.m. to 5  p.m. PST.
Please direct all correspondence to traders whose deals are in  question.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience - but hopefully I'll be smarter  when I come back!
I'll check in and wrap things up at 5:00, so if you have any questions you'd  like to save for me, I'll be at my desk then.
Thanks,
