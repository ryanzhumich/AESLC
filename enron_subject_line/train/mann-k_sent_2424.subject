Hi Chris,  Happy New Year.
Hope all is going well with you.
We miss you!
I heard a rumor that the UI deal had an asset management aspect to it.
The  guys around here are kicking around some different asset management ideas, so  I'm trying to get my hands on any docs which might give some insight into  some  different approaches.
Do you have anything you can email me?
Thanks,
