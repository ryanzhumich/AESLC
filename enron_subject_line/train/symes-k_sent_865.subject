This is a problem I've been working on with IT.
They released a new version  of deal entry, and for some reason certain EOL trades are automatically  populating all of the new fields, including Schedule Type.
I've got Dave  Poston working on this, and I'll let you know when we've fixed it so you can  save your part.
Thanks,
