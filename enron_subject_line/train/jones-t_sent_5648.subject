If you like, I can get you database access that will allow you to review the  comments between Legal & Credit.
We do not give this level of access to  non-Legal & Credit people because we are trying to limit certain information  for client-attorney privilege (not to mention the business people give away  our negotiating positions!).
If you would like this level of access, let me  know and I will put in a request.
This level of access will also give you  edit capability, so you need to be careful not to change things by mistake.
