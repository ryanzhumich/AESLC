Chris, as per our discussion, I just want to confirm that we have the ability  to break the contract with the EPC provider at any time.
Further, I want to  confirm that our costs will be minimal and that this whole process (ie  putting a number on a term sheet) has been based on trying to maximize the  short run value of the project.
In other works, we have no intention of  lifting their offer.
Finally, we are not ordering HRSG's or steam turbines.
These guys add no value and they are killing me!
