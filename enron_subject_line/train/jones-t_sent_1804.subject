Raquel Guzman, the lawyer for the referenced counterparty called again, and  she is going on vacation next week and wants to get that ETA finalized so  they can start trading when she's out.
She seems to feel the way the ETA is  written that they are responsible for all unauthorized use of the password,  including hackers into the system, and wants the language limited to use  caused by their fault or negligence.
Can you call her at 215/684-6630.
Thanks.
