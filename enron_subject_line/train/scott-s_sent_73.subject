I've gotten a bit more educated about IT revenue crediting since you asked  your question yesterday.
"IT revenue crediting" is an industry term used to  describe a requirement (brought about either by a FERC order or a rate case  settlement) that IT revenues in excess of a certain dollar amount will be  credited back to all firm shippers in the next rate proceeding or thru some  refund mechanism.
Transwestern is currently not under any IT revenue  crediting obligation, and I would be very hesitant to negotiate any such  obligation with any individual shipper because then we would have to do the  same for all firm shippers on a nondiscriminatory basis.
If you need more info, let's talk.
