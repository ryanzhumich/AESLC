On Friday we distributed  RFPs for securing bridge gas.
Letters went today  to Chaco, TotalfinaElf, Andina, Maxus, BritishGas and Petrobras for them to  quote us 6-month gas with our option to extend for another 6 months.
We have  given them until March 2nd to respond.
Pete Weidler will meet with YPF (hopefully with Ernesto Lopez Anad?n) the  week of the 19th.
