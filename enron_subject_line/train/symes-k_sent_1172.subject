I've gone ahead and entered the counterparty name "Sierra Pacific Industries,  Inc." in Chris Foster's deal #573679, in the interest of moving it along  through the confirmation process.
(The deal was done on 4/6 and flowed on  4/10.)
I spoke with Bob Ellery (Sierra) yesterday and he seemed fine with the name  we have in our system, although I'm sure he's not the final authority.
Then I  spoke with the Confirms group today and they were ready to get the deal off  of their new deal report.
So, since I haven't heard anything to the contrary,  I changed the deal from it's "new counterparty" status.
Please let me know if this presents a problem for any of you.
Thanks,
