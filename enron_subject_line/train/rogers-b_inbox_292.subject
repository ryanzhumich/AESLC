Ben,  I was again good to talk with you and I look forward to the possibilities.
As we spoke of, Joe Toussaint is heading up the talent initiative and coordinating the recruiting process.
I spoke with Joe today and he informed me he had left several contact numbers for you so I will at this point step out of the middle of process to allow for a more coordinated approach.
I'm sure I speak for Joe when I say we believe the changes in the industry as well as Enron provide opportunity for us both.
Please provide Joe with your resume as soon as you can and as we discussed be prepared to discuss your desires, skills and/or experiences you believe uniquely qualify you, as well as examples of your ability to create value.
Again it has been my pleasure and I'm sure Joe or his designee will contact you concerning your trip to Cincinnati and scheduled activities next week.
Michael J. Cyrus President & CEO, Cinergy, Energy Merchant
