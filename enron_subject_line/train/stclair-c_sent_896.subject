Here is my first cut at a proposed form of amendment.
I have added a rep and  an additional Event of Default to cover the 'Lien" issue in light of the fact  that Barrett's Credit Agreement restricts them from entering into any  agreement that contains a negative pledge.
I winged the amendment to the  Confirmations since I have not seen them yet.
Please call me with any  comments.
