Per VNG's request, ENA released 700 dt of CGAS capacity to Nabisco effective 1/1/2001 - 12/31/2001.
Yesterday, CGAS informed me that Nabisco has not paid any of their bills.
CGAS was under the impression that ENA should be paying Nabisco's bill.
I told CGAS to find chat with the company doing the nominations for Nabisco and to keep me informed.
