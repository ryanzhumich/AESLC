Reed and Lana, thanks again for a great stay in the hills!
We all had a  blast and I'm happy to report that Britt and Tina are bragging to their  little classmates about their newfound skiing prowess!
Next thing you know  they'll be starring in a Warren Miller video!
Have a great time in BC and  say hi to Brad and Jen for us.
