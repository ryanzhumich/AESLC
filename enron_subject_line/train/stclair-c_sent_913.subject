Rod: I don't know if you are still handling this.
We are close to getting this  finalized.
One credit comment from them that I need someone's thoughts on.
They want the Issuer of LC's to maintain a credit rating of A from S&P and A2  from Moody's.
We usually put A- and A3.
are you okay with this?
If I need  to run this by someone else please let me know.
