Gregg,  I talked with Ellen Dailey, Reliant's attorney, yesterday.
Subject to the  credit departments approval of the credit items that Reliant copied from the  ENA/Reliant proposed contract, the other items in the contract requested by  Reliant have been discussed and resolved.
As soon as I hear from Russell  Diamond, I will finalize the contract and sent to you and to Reliant.
