Cynthia:  As you know, the Bankruptcy Code revisions never made it through the recent  Congress.
I understand they bogged down in the final days over issues which  were essentially irrelevant to us in ECT.
I'm not sure you are aware of the  importance to our trading business of certain of the other proposed  revisions.
We anticipate that the revisions will be reintroduced in the next  Congress and are beginning to think about ways that we can influence the  outcome this time around.
Are you the right person in your shop for us to  talk to about this?
If you could let me know, I'd appreciate it.
Thanks,
