Janine:  I would like to meet with you (and Guenther) regarding two topics:  (1)  softs trading (together with Bob Bruce)  (2)  credit trading (do we need anyone else?)
Either of Tuesday or Friday morning works fine.
Let me propose 9 am Tuesday  for softs and 10 am for credit (and I am flexible).
Bob and I are located  only several offices apart on the 38th floor of the Enron building.
We look forward to hearing from you.
