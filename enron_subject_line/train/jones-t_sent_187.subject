Just a reminder that if you change any of the resolutions contained in our  Swap Resolutions Notebook, you need to update the Index, and substitute the  revised resolutions into each of the Swap Group's persons Notebooks.
These  would include for any of the trading companies, the resolutions that approve  what we trade (which also includes who can sign the appropriate documents),  as well as the brokerage approval resolutions.
It does not include the  Confirmation signatories.
