I have taken what I believe this is the most recent form of the GE turbine  contract, changed to reflect the difference in purchaser, and filled in some  of the blanks.
I have compared it against the Delta redline that Rick sent  me this afternoon, after having accepted Delta's proposed changes for the  purpose of running the comparison.
The notes included are placeholders  since I wasn't clear if these items will change with the equipment swap.
GE is also reviewing Salmon Energy Agreeement version 2.  redline             Thanks,
