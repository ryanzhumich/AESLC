When you buy from the imbalance(Services 2mw for HE 17-22) please make sure that you buy from the correct zone(i.e.
if finals have sp load dec'd then the buy from the imbalance in enpower needs to be in sp).
Day shift, assumed the ISO would make a buy from NP and for 3 hours they dec'd SP load.
Even better if you know that you are going to buy from the imbalance then submit a schedule that is BALANCED,  in this case they should have created a new load zone in SP under the Services book and inserted a -2 for HE 17-22.
As always we don't want to buy from the imbalance but if all other options have been exhausted then at least submit your preferred zone to purchase from rather than leaving the ISO to roll the dice and force balance you how ever they want.
