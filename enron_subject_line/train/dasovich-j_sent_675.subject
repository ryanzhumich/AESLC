Good morning professor: Unfortunately, I'm traveling on business today (it's raing in Vancouver) and  can't attend class tonite.
I was wondering if you'd be distributing the take  home midterm in this evening's class.
Also, could you resend the access code  for the Craftmade case?
I believe that I copied it down incorrectly.
Thank  you very much.
Best,
