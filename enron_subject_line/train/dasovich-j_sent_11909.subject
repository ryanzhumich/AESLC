The Bond Legislation The Democrats in the Assembly and Sentate have agreed to language to create a  Dedicated Rate Component to repay the budget and de-link the bonds from the  DWR contracts.
But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along.
The bill would require a 2/3's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so  Republican votes are necessary.
The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to  go along.
The Conference Committee Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this  point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the  core/noncore proposal.
Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill  than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is  uncertain.
No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference
