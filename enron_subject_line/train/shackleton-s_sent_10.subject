As we discussed last week, ECT is sending a demand letter to Sonoco for the  underpayment of $60,000.
I need the attachment which I have identified as  merely Exhibit "A" to appear on a single sheet of paper (legal is fine).
We  discussed your revision to cover the entire term of the swap AND revisions to  the month of January, 1999 to reflect ECT's floating price as .33 (which will  cause changes to the invoice amount and difference columns).
Also, instead  of the term "Sonoco Price", I would prefer the caption "Floating Price  recognized by Sonoco".
Please call if you have questions.
Thanks.
