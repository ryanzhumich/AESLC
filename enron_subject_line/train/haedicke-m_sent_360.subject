Mark:  A concern has been raised about IT service providers working on EOL or other  Enron projects and then taking know-how to a competitor, such as Dynegy.
Since these service providers tend to work for a lot of different companies,  it seems like this is a significant issue.
How do we address this risk in  the contracts?
Do we need to add a non-competition clause?
