Here's a first stab at the LOI.
I just guessed on the attachment.
I have a couple of questions:  Any thought as to how we get/split money (other than the obvious up side for  us)?
Do we want to work toward a "Project Development Agreement" which will set  forth the basis for how we develop projects on a project-by-project basis?
Or  do you envision a different next step?
Talk to you soon,  Kay
