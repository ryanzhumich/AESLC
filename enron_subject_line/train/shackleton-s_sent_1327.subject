Jay:  I am a lawyer with Enron.
I called for you on Friday, you're out, and  no one else could help.
I would like to speak with a Vitol lawyer about (1)  replacing our existing financial master with an ISDA (to accommodate a  broader range of products) and (2) specifically incorporating the relevant  ISDA definitions into the recent weather transaction confirmations even  though the master is an early master energy price swap agreement.
Please  call me at 713 853-5620 with the information so that we can move quickly.
Thank you for your help.
Sara
