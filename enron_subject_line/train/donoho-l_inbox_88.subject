As a follow-up to our discussion when I was in Houston, attached is a memo that addresses how negotiated rate contracts will be treated in Transwestern's next rate case.
I had drafted the memo in response to numerous questions from BP regarding their Red Rock contract rate.
Pls.
let me know if you have further questions.
Thanks, Maria
