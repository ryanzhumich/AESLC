Attached please find the referenced counterparty approval lists.
Per my  conv.
w/Frank and Leslie Hansen's emails, on a going forward basis, U.S.  based counterparties should not be approved for European based physical power  products, and vice versa.
I don't know how you want to handle that, I have  not "Xed" out European physical power from the attached list.
What should we  do on a going forward basis?
