Sorry I missed you earlier - please blame Louise who refused to let me leave  the meeting I was in with her to call.
I tried to call you in London just  now but there was no answer.
If you are still around, please feel free to  try me again but if that doesn't work I will be in all next week and am happy  to set up a time that works for you.
