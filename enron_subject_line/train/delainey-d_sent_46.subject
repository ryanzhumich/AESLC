Jim, I really don't see a need for this meeting - you can count on us not  dropping the ball.
I have a good understanding of the retail product  offering, in fact, we lead the outsourcing sales process for the large  industrial customers in NA until EES bought back their minority  shareholders.
I have a very good relationship with Dan Leff and Sunde.
I  already have Dan's committment to help service the execution of the business  initially.
As it grows and the product proves itself out we can staff.
Regards
