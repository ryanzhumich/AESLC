I wish it were more clear.
I am trying to get down there to talk to the  commercial people about the business direction and support we can provide but  until then I don't know that we should get their hopes up.
I had hoped to  come this week but Randy is here in Houston.
Maybe second half of next  week?
Do you know if everyone will be in those days?
(I was thinking Sao  Paolo Wed/Thurs and B.A.
Thurs/Fri).
