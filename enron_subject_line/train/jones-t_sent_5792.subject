Attached is a clean and a blacklined draft of the BETA.
This draft was  created using the new BETA form, and the blackline compares this draft  against the form.
I have also attached a blackline from the intial draft we  sent counterparty to the draft we are sending counterparty now, in case you  want to show them all the changes from that draft.
That blackline is called  prebon.red below.
