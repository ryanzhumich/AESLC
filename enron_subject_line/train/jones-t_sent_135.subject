I am trying to track down in London the author of an ISDA Schedule on the  deal between ECT and the ETOL Trust.
The top of the Schedule says "Milbank  Draft" and the document # on the botton says LN1: #20030058v5.
Robina  Barker-Bennett in Treasury left Mark Taylor an email about this, and I left  her a voicemail trying to track down the document, but haven't heard back.
I  would think the document was prepared by one of your lawyers.
Mark needs the  computer document so we can do a blackline against another agreement here in  Houston.
Can you see what you can do to track it down for me.
I'd appreciate it.
