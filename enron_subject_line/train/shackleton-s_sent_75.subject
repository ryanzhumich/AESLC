I had a VERY long call with the two lawyers.
I would say for the most part  that Tiger will reconsider many of our provisions now that the lawyers  understand our position.
Big issues:  arbitration (I need an explanation in  order to go to our general counsel)                                           Limitiation of Liability  All else is negotiable.
