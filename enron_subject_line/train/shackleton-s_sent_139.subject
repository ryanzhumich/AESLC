Hello there!
I know that you are out of the country.
Thanks for forwarding  the message from Andre Cangucu.
I have been through your materials but do  not find any involvement you may have had with specific swaps; the items I  found were generic and were in the form of law firm memoranda (e.g.,  "Derivatives and FX Transactions in Brazil", "Trading with Brazilian  Counterparties", etc.).
Am I missing something?
Look forward to seeing you  soon.
Sara
