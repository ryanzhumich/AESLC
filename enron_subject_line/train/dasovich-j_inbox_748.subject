Jeff, Gas Daily has an article on DWR activities for purchasing gas.... do you know Pete Garris and is he the guy we want to get together with... or is Balwin's co. going to carry the ball.
I remain unclear as to who actually is doing the gas buying..  Further to our conversation of last week... let's meet with these guys soonest.
