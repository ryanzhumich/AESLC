I'm walking into the lion's den on Thursday (a/k/a Chicago) to discuss  various matters.
I know Laura is anxious to move forward on the Manlove  deal.
I thought it might be really neat if we (Legal) could have a game plan  for this deal, described by Laura as being "like the Bammel deal".
If I can  get Laura to commit to a time, how about a conference call to discuss where  to go with this?
I'm taking the long way to Chicago (via Connecticut), but will be checking  voice mail, etc.
Thanks,
