Okay...My itinerary is as follows:  Arriving in San Diego 2:20 am Friday  night (I'll need your new address for the cab) and departing Sunday at 6:15  pm.
If you just want to leave the key under the mat that would be perfect  for me...I'll probably crash immediately anyway.
I am so excited to be  coming out there - -  I really need a break from Houston...not to mention  work.
The Gas Lamp district Saturday night sounds like fun and I would love  to meet your friends.
Also, please don't feel like you have to plan the  whole weekend, I have no problem going with the flow.
See you in a couple of weeks, Susan
