Tanya: When the Columbia purchase was done in January, did the 1/30/98 ISDA Master  between ENA and Columbia Energy Services Corporation stay with Columbia or  come over to us?
The reason that I am asking is that they have sent ENA a  letter notifying us of Columbia's transfer of its rights under such Master to  The New Power Company, so it seems as if they believe that that Master was  not part of our acquisition.
Who in credit needs to be aware of this if in  fact this Master will be assigned to New Power?
