Guys, I can't recall how the corporate opportunity is managed between Canada  and the US for these customers particularily with regard to their  transactions in Michigan et al.
Is Eastern Canada now managed by the Central  desk from a trading and mid-market point of view since Story came down to  Houston?
How are the structured deals managed?
Is this still the right split  for the business?
Regards
