Hi Al,  My suggestion is that you capture the change order with change order #1 for  PSCO's break out contract.
If it needs to be paid before year end (which it  probably does) you can put a payment date of December 20th, and it will be  paid out of TurboPark.
This approach has been discussed with Lee Johnson at  GE, and he is fine with it.
Thanks,
