I just got a call from Stuart Rosman, who is meeting with the referenced  counterparty right now.
NCPA would like to get a password in place today to  start trading, and there seems to be some confusion as to what types of  transactions they can do online.
Per my earlier approval, this counterparty  can trade any physical products under the credit terms established by  Credit.
They, however, cannot trade financial until we get an ISDA Master in  place (and have told Stuart they are currently not interested in trading  financial).
Stuart said he would be calling Carrie in about 1/2 to make sure this message  is conveyed to her.
If anyone is aware of any problems here, please convey them to Carrie ASAP!
