Okay - third time's the charm.
After cuts were made by the Cal-ISO last  night, I sent you a revised volume schedule of our sales to EES for 1/31;  however, I failed to change the total load at SP-15 to reflect cuts.
Now  you'll see the CORRECT revisions made at all delivery points.
Let me know if  you have questions.
Thanks,
