Hi Ginger:  Rick and I spoke and decided that it would be a good idea to provide UC  Berkeley's Graduate School of Public Policy with a small stipend of $2,500 to  help underwrite a conference they're sponsoring with the business school on  Monday.
I'll be participating in the conference.
Could you please make the check payable to (the faceless)  "UC Regents" and  send it to:  Heather Cameron Richard and Rhoda Goldman School of Public Policy University of California 2607 Hearst Avenue Berkeley, CA  94720   The school's Federal Taxpayer ID is:  946002123.
Thanks very much.
If you have any questions, don't hesitate.
Best,
