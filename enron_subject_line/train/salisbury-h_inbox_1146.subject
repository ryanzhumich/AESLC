What many of you have probably sensed was going to happen has now officially been confirmed: As of June 11,  Steve Hall will be changing his status from  full time Enron-dedicated outside counsel to  full time Enron employee , reporting to Elizabeth Sager in Houston.
Coming as it does, at a time when trading legal expertise is much in demand in the market, this is a very positive event.
Our team will no doubt continue to benefit from Steve's significant contributions.
