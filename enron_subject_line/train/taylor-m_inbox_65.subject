Hi Mark,  Attached is a Service Level Agreement for our deal with Global View Software.
Forthcoming will be two attachments - one that gives EOL contact names and numbers and one that outlines the hardware in detail.
I assume that neither will have any bearing on the SLA.
We would like to see it turned around in a week or so if at all possible.
Global View actually has the hardware and we are in the middle of some user acceptance testing.
Please give me a call if any questions.
Thanks,
