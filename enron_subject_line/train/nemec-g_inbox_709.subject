Gerald,  Here are the documents on the Questar open seasons that Stephanie discussed with you.
Since the precedent agreements are binding, we would like to put in some sort of contingency clause to give Enron a potential out.
Unfortunately, we only have the PAs in pdf format, so we may need to just write in whatever language we need.
The Denver office will be meeting with Questar on Tuesday or Wednesday to discuss the open season details, and we can touch base after then.
Have a good holiday weekend.
Phil
