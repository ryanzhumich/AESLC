Louis,  When I started July 31st, you arranged parking for me in the Regency garage  until the time that a spot opened up to get on an Enron contract (I am not  currently).
I haven't heard anything, and I know some people that have  obtained Enron parking.
I signed my name to a list that you circulated at  orientation.
Is there something further that I need to do?
