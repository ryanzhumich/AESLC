It seems that Miriam Radach has been transferred to Sherman & Sterling's  Washington D.C. office.
She is working with a NY associate named Jennifer  Kumble.
The lawyers had a lot of issues to discuss with Tiger and should  give us comments next week.
Have a nice holiday!
I'm going to Baton Rouge  to watch the tigers (LSU!)
play ball.
