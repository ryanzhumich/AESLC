I participated last weekend in the Leadership Forum for Fall 2001 of the Center for Houston's Future.
I wanted to thank you for recommending me as a member of the Forum.
I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to meet so many interesting, talented members of the Houston community.
I know that I will enjoy working with the group during our second session, November 1-3, as well as collaborating on some "homework" assignments that we will complete between now and then.
I especially am excited about the possibilities of making an impact on Houston's future through developing both relationships and action steps  through my association with the Center.
Thanks again for making this opportunity available to me.
