I received a notice through Janet that if we don't pay $100k to California PUC by 12/26/01 our EEMC registration is suspended.
THIS MEANS THAT THE MONEY MUST BE THERE TOMORROW.
Suspension includes ceasing serving residential and small commercial (all accounts below 20kw) within 48 hours.
I think that we've already paid, but Jeff is checking.
If not, Wade please arrange payment to   Howard Shyrock Energy Division - 4th Floor CPUC 505 Van Ness Avenue SF, CA 94102  Thanks.
