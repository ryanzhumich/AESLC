Hi Mike,  Since we haven't had any luck hooking up on the telephone, I wanted to  transmit to you an initial draft of a facility agreement, as contemplated by  the contract for the transformer packages for the LM's.
I would have sent  this to Dave, but I don't seem to have his email address.
Since the WestLB financing facility is scheduled to expire soon, we need to  get the transformers transferred into our new facility, as well as get them  contractually allocated to various projects.
Please give me a call or have  Dave call me so that we can handle this as expeditiously as possible.
Thanks,
