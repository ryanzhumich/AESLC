Paul -   Thanks for your voice mail.
We can't print the list of Reference Entities  from the website because we have not been given access.
We do need to get  that list to the various other reviewers in Houston and I am sure that is the  list that Michael referred to.
The EnronOnline people are probably concerned because they don't have a final  list of Reference Entities for their launch.
That list absolutely must be  scrubbed by the other GC's before it is approved.
Mark
