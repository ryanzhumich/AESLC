Hi Catherine,  I don't remember who actually gives the notice, but in anticipation of the  funding of the escrow tomorrow, here are the docs.
I understand there is also a two day notice.
I don't believe I've seen a  form for that one yet.
Who should send this out tomorrow after we get the fed ref?
Thanks,
