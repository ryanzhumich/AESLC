Hi Mark.
I heard you guys had a great time in Africa - it's hard to believe  it has already come and gone!
Just wondering if you still have your unused KLM ticket for the  Istanbul/Amsterdam/Nairobi leg of the trip.
That is a refundable ticket, so  if you would return it to me I can get Jeff's card credited for the charge -  I believe it's in the neighborhood of $2,000.
If you have it, just drop it  in the mail to:  Sherri Sera c/o Enron Corp. P.O.
Box 1188 Houston, TX 77251-1188 U.S.A.
Thanks and take care,
