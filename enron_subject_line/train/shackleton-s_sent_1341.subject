Trena:  Can you please let me know if the docs from Chase are to amend the  existing Repo Agreement between ENA and Chase?
What type of transactions  will you be doing with Chase?
The docs I received are from a woman named  Monica Turner and she has not returned my phone call.
She did not provide an  email address so I don't know how to get in touch with Chase.
Can you help?
Maybe get me another name?
Thanks.
Sara
