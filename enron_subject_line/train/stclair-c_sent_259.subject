Stacy: John had asked me to review a form of Guaranty from Alberta Energy Company  Ltd.  As it turns out, the Guarantor will be the counterparty on all  financial trades so this Guaranty will only support physical deals done by  Alberta's affiliates.
I had commented on it and they had responded.
Could  you please take a look at their response and coordinate with John on this?
Thanks.
