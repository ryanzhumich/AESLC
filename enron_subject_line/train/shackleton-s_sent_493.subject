AFAC - Thank you for your response.
It is difficult for me when I do not  hear from you since I am not in Sao Paulo but I understand that you were  engaged in other Enron matters.
I am looking forward to your response since  the trading issues are not going away (the issues seem to only multiply).
Once "the Enron group" has had an opportunity to review, we would like to  schedule another meeting with you and Marcelo in Sao Paulo.
I look forward  to receiving the memo and chart.
Thank you and regards.
Sara
