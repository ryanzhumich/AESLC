Mark and Jarrod: Regarding this project of streamlining weather confirms, Shari asked about  the new language that we were gong to use to define the procedures for  determining the Fallback reference Weather Station.
Has that language ever  been finalized?
This is one of the things that I thought we could pull out  of the confirms so before we send out any Master Agreement amendments, we  should try to get this language finalized.
