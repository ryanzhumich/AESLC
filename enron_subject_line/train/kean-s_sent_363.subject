Jeff Skilling proposed a solution to Gov Davis to solve the supply and  pricing problems in the California market.
In summary, the proposal would  have a neutral party conduct an auction wherein the utilities would seek bids  for 5-10 year packages of power from suppliers.
The gov asked if anyone had  successfully conducted such an auction in the industry already.
I need your help to identify and describe any such examples (European or  North American) by mid day Monday.
Jeff and I will have a follow up call with  the governor on Monday.
Thanks
