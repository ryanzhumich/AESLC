Samantha:  You're doing a great job with Lotus Notes!!
I'm impressed.
Just  a few thoughts about some agreements which have fallen through the cracks (on  record keeping):  (1)  ABN AMRO in Australia (futures) -  Jason is working on this (2)  Bank One (give-up agreement)  -  Mary is now working on this
