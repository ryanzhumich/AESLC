Zulie: I am teaching a junior achievement course to a third grade class at my son's  school.
I would like to reward these kids for the work that they have done  and someone in my group mentioned that in some cases, Enron has something  akin to a "goodie bag" that they give out to kids.
Would I be eligible for  this?
I wasn't sure if I would and thought that at least it doesn't hurt to  ask.
My extension is 33989.
