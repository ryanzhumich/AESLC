Hey, evidently I'm not the only one slacking on the emails - That means you  Em.
Quick update:  I may try to come over Oct 5 - 10 instead of the 4 - 9 so that  I can at least spend a little time with Katy.
How will that work for y'all?
Sue  P.S.
- Thought you'd like to know that I am doing well in regards to the Ted  situation.
I'm actually kind of glad he took this week long vacation...that  whole out-of-sight, out-of-mind theory really works.
