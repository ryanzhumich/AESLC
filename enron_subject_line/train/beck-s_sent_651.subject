Does the info as provided from HR indicate MBA's from UT?
I know that Enron  probably has a number of undergrads from UT.
At this point, I am  specifically interested in UT MBA's, as it is the Houston Chapter of UT's  Graduate Business Network for which I will now serve on the steering  committee.
Thanks!
