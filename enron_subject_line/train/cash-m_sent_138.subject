Drew,  At one point, we had mentioned the idea of having services agreements among  Corp. and the various business units that are using shared services.
I think  that these agreements should be put into place sooner rather than later as we  begin to move towards shared services across the organization.
Let me know if you would like me to prepare the drafts of these agreements or  revise agreements that currently are in existence (if there are none, then we  really need to put some in place).
Thanks.
