FYI -  I spoke with Misti Day today regarding negative orig that was flashed and  booked to GD - Central.
This negative orig(revenue) is being transferred to  the Central desk to cover the transportation demand charges that were  incurred related to this orig.
Per Misti, this amount will come through in  November and needs to be reclassed to July August adn September.
Cathy has  the correct amounts on her back pages.
Please shout with any questions.
