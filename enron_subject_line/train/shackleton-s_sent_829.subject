I have been receiving the "Enron International Southern Cone" list of  projects (updated weekly) for the B.A.
office for quite some time.
As you  know, it covers trading Projects and Claims/Litigation/Regulatory.
Is there  a similar list prepared for projects originating in Brazil?
I would like to  recieve such a list as would the parties copied above.
Please let me know.
Regards.
Sara
