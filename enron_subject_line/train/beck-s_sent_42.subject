I apologize for the late notice, but Sally has just been notified that a  cross-functional PRC meeting w/ Rick Causey has been set for this Friday,  December 1.
She will need a compilation of your accomplishments by  Thursday.
If you have directors reporting to you, please request that they  also have data in to Sally by Thursday.
Thanks for your help,
