Joan,  Attached is the Letter Agreement for St. Mary's Production LLC.
According  to Charlie, St. Mary's production is being delivered at the same points as is  the Hunt Southern Louisiana production.
Therefore, the St. Mary's letter is  identical to the Hunt letter which Charlie is sending to Hunt today.
If this  is not the case, please let me know and I will modify to fit the terms of the  St. Mary's deal.
Otherwise, please print off as many originals as you need  and send them to St. Mary's for their execution and return.
Please call if  you have any questions.
