Hello-  For my own use, I put together the attached list of outstanding DMS requests and plan to do so at the end of each week.
It occurred to me that perhaps this spreadsheet would be a helpful tool for all of you to see as well.
If you have any additions/corrections (my apologies for any mistakes!
), please let me know.
Also, please let me know if you would like me to forward to you an updated spreadsheet like this on a weekly basis.
Note:  I only pulled "Need Further Documentation" requests from bankruptcy forward.
Thanks!
