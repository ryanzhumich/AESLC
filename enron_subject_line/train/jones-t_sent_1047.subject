We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement between the  referenced Counterparty and ENA dated April 27, 2000.
The copy will be  forwarded to Dave Samuels.
It is my intention that Dave Samuels maintain a complete file of all the  Confidentiality Agreements for EnronOnline.
If there is some otherr person  than Dave who sould maintain the central file repository for EnronOnline  Confidentiality Agreements please this let me know.
