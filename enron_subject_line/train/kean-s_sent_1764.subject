Joe:  Thanks again for coming to Houston this week.
CNN has a compelling brand and we believe that a number of the components of  your proposal are worth exploring further.
However, we are not interested in pursuing discussions of the exclusive  sponsorship.
I want to stress, though, that many of the elements of the package you and  David presented are of interest and we would like to continue discussions  with you.
Please get in touch with us to discuss how we proceed from here.
Thanks again.
