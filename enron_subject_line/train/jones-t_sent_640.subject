I don't know where we stand on reviewing the derivatives situation for the  referenced counterparty, but Frank Davis with EOL just called and the  counterparty is applying for a password, so he wanted to refresh his memory  why we wouldn't open them up for derivatives trading.
I told him that we  were just looking at their situation last week, and to give your name & # to  the counterparty if they question why they can't trades derivatives.
It  isn't clear to me that we're ready to change our opinion on them yet.
