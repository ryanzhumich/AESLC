Peggy Mahoney asked me to forward this to you.
FYI - Here is a link to the Boston Globe article I have discussed with most of you.
After numerous conversations and plenty of information proving otherwise, the reporter unfortunately decided to do this article based upon recent happenings.
It is clearly a cheap shot.
On a happier note, here is a good article about our relationship with Quaker Oats in the Chicago Sun-Times.
Thanks,
