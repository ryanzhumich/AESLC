What person(s) in London prepares credit for the English and Singapore  financial transactions?
At some point in the not so distant future, the  Houson and London credit departments need to speak in order that each  understands the "philosophy" behind credit analysis for the omnibus and  master transactions.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Regards.
Sara  ps  Congrats on your promotion!
I didn't have a chance to speak with you  after the offsite to shake your hand.
Hope you enjoyed your weekend in  Houston.
