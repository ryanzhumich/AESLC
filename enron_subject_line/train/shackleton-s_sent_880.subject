Jeff Nogid has called about putting some ENE masters in place.
I have  already spoken with Clement about this.
ENE will be trading FX, interest  rate and equities through Gary's group.
Jeff mentioned names such as Merrill  Lynch Cap.
Services, Credit Suisse and Sumitomo.
He will obtain specific  names and contacts at the various firms and forward that information to me  and/or Shari.
We'll let you know.
