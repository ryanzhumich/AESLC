Scott: Mark Holsworth suggested that I send this draft Agreement to you which  provides for Enron's transfer of the domain name weather-desk.com.
I am  particular concerned about our ability to make the reps in Section 3.
What I  am sending you reflects our comments to the other party's draft.
I look  forward to hearing from you.
