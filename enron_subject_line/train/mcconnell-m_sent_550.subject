George,  I would like to have a brief (30 minute) meeting about the noise in the  political system about synfuel and reaffirm Jordon's viewpoint on Section 29  credits.
This is big issue and without this reaffirmation I believe we will  have approval issues with RAC and others.
I want Jeff and/or I in the  meeting.
Thanks,
