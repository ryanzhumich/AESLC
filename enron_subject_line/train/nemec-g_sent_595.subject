Attached is a revised construction agreement (redlined version) incorporating  the changes we discussed.
I have not changed either the liquidated damages  or force majeure provisions at this point.
Ron, you indicated in your voice  mail that you wanted to wait until things firmed up a bit more with respect  to those provisions.
Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
Not sure if we should forward to EE&CC at this point yet, given the  uncertainty on the two provisions.
What are your thoughts?
Thanks
