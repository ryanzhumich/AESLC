BH,   Sorry I didn't get these to you last night.
I left the office sooner than  planned.
This list is pretty slim.
I spent much time trying to learn to  trade Waha, which took a considerable amount of time away from producing  reults for you.
With me now concentrating on operations and with the plan to  hire an additional person, this will change.
Let me know if you have any  questions on my list of accomplishments.
