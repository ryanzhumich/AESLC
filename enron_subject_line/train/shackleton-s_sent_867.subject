In discussing the Omnibus with outside counsel on a deal, I am not clear that  the definition of "Loss" picks up the concept of "Unpaid Amounts."
Arguably  it does (although the concept of "Unpaid Amounts" is built into the ECT  Master upon which the Omnibus was based for Early Termination for Events of  Default but not followed through entirely for Accelerated Termination Date).
My guess is that we decided that Omnibus "Loss" pv of economic loss includes  both past amounts owed/subsequent valuation.
Can you recall?
