Kimat, It looks like we have some deals booked twice.
Take a look at my  worksheet.
All volumes are monthly, positive is supply, negative is a sale.
Also, I believe deals 231667 and 226703 should be moved to New Power.
What about deal 202939?
Normally, I move this deal to CGAS and its very  confusing the way I do it.
