I would like to add electronic index descriptions to the database.
Please  refernece Gas Daily publication, page three for the location of these  indices.
We can simply insert the location of the electronic index where we  currenly have the gas daily index survey language in the gd swaps in the  database.
I would like to have electronic gd swaps for the following  points.
El Paso Permian, El Paso , non-bondad, Kern River/Opal Plant, Socal  Gas, large packages.
We will need to add electronic to the product title to  differentiate between the two gd swaps.
Thanks,
