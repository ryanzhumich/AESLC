I just spoke to Sara Shackleton and she approved opening FPL for all  financial trading.
She has also been discussing the utilities with outside  counsel and we may be able to open more up for trading.
She is going to  bring a copy of my list to the Legal Conference and review it, so hopefully  we'll have some more changes for you next week.
