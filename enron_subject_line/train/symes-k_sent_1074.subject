Good afternoon, IT Wizards -  I'm curious about a feature on the new Forward Obligation Report.
It is now  possible to run the report showing term, scheduled, or liquidated deals.
In  the past I've always run the report showing term deals, then entered my  desk-to-desk deals from those numbers.
Now I believe the report is designed  to pull data from our scheduling database, so I'm wondering what the  difference is between the term deal report and the scheduled deal report.
Each produce completely different numbers!
Please let me know when you get a  chance.
Thanks,
