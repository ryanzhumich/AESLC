Michael Slade forwarded me your advice  with respect to the Non-Disclosure  Agreement with i2 Technologies.
We appreciate your help on this.
Per my  conversation with Mark Taylor, this NDA will probably be the first of many  coming from the EnronCredit.com business group located here in Houston and  pursuing US based customers.
We wanted to confirm with you that on a going  forward basis that are no tax problems with these EnronCredit.com employees  executing NDA's as well as other contracts here in Houston.
Thanks for your  help with this.
