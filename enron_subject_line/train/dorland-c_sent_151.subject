I went to Kelly Blue Book on the internet and they provide 2 values for used  vehicles, a trade in value (what you might expect to get for a vehicle from a  dealer on trade in) and a retail value (what you might expect to pay for a  vehicle from a dealer).
The following were the values it came up with for a  Jeep exactly like mine in Montana (closest state).
Trade In - $15330 USD ($22750 CND) Retail - $20945 USD ($31061 CND)  The retail number seems way too high.
I think something like $23 000 to  $25000 would be fair.
Let me know what you think.
