Greetings:  Sounds like I'm glad that I missed the quiz last week.
Hate to be a nag, but we've got to turn in what we're doing for our project  on Thursday.
I propose doing a nice, clean merger, which would allow us to  do both comparative analysis (who are these companies?)
and merger/valuation  analysis.
Mark and I talked last night and I pleaded again not to do strict  accounting stuff, but if that's what folks would like to do, I can certainly  suck it up.
Any thoughts?
Best,
