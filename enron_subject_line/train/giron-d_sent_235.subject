How are you feeling?
I'm very tired and stiff.
I've been thinking, and I  know you feel like I make all of the decisions around our house when it comes  to $.
So I want us to do what you want on the pool and a car when it comes  to financing.
I will completely agree with whatever you think we should do.
And I'm not doing this for any other reason except that I want you to know  that I value your judgement and ideas.
Have a great day.
As always, I love  you very much.
