Melissa,  I wasn't able to redline this version, but I added sections 10 and  11 and added futher language to Sections 3 and 6.
Hopefully you can redline  it against your old version.
Let me know what you think about environmental indemnity language.
I think  is is prudent from the view that Black Hills and has been using the Premises  for some time and we are not sure what is out there.
