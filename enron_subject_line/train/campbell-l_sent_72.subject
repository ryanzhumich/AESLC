Max, I spoke to Pete Metzner of METRIC Corporation about the status of the  environmental assessment you need for the above project and he said that he  has received the packet you sent him but he needs to have additional  clearification on some items which are pertinant for completing the EA.
Mr.  Metzner was concerned that he would not be able to complete the EA by the  specified time unless he discussed these issues with you.
METRIC has  extensive experience with environmental assessments, but is not familiar with  pipeline terminology and pipeline actions proposed uder the agreement with  the Office of Pipeline Safety.
When you get a chance, would you please contact Pete at (505) 828-2801.
Thanks.
