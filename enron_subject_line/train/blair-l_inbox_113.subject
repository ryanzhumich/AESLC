Attached below are the two files for TW CMS/TMS requirements on flow direction and current process for inside/outside the path requirements.
Please review these documents and let me know if you have any questions or  corrections to apply to either document by COB 8/31/01.
Linda, please keep me in the loop on both of the projects since they interface directly with TMS.
Thanks Ramona
