Stacy,  The Reliant Energy changes which Ellen Dailey sent to you in August appeared  in my chair this morning.
I had discussed the Enovate/Reliant changes with  Ellen yesterday and we resolved most of the language except for the items I  noted as being Credit Dept calls, which Russell has yet to respond to.
I  agreed to make similar changes to the ENA/Reliant contract to that agreed  upon in the Enovate/Reliant contract.
In reviewing the materials that Ellen  sent you as marked, it appears that we had resolved all of the items in the  ENA/Reliant markup except for the credit driven items.
Therefore, I will  create a red-line and send back to Ellen next week, if Russell responds to my  earlier emails and to this email.
Call if this is not what you desire.
