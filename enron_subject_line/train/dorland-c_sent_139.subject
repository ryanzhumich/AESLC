Nav,  How are you doing?
What are you doing?
I am still working for Enron.
I have  been trading nat gas for about 3 years.
I am moving to Houston at the end of  the month.
In my next life I am going to be trading electricity in the NE US.
Should be interesting.
Crazy volatility.
I will probably have a heart attack  at 26 but that's life.
Hope things are going well for you.
w/b   Chris Dorland
