Here's what I've added to my answer to address Ni's question.
Let me know if  you have comments.
I'll have a final draft out shortly.
Prior to the deadline for filing interventions, Transwestern received a  request from Commission staff for clarification of the criteria for awarding  of Shipper call options.
The procedure will be as follows:  an advance  posting will specify the term of the available option, term of transportation  service, transportation volume, and instructions for bidding.
Shipper call  options will be awarded based upon the highest rate payable for the option  component.
