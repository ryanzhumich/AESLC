It is too late in the day in London for me to catch you by phone today.
I  will call you tomorrow and would like to throw out an idea regarding an  on-going resource for operations in London.
If you are comfortable with my  idea, then I can discuss it in person with Fernley while he is here this  week.
We have time on the calendar plus dinner this week.
