We are parking 4,875 dth/day for the 27th-30th on CNG (deal 281565) and we  are taking out 478 dth/day for the month of June (deal 281565).
ENA is  paying CNG $.04 times the total volume parked.
Angie, these volumes may go up.
I think Tenn is still trying to balance the  weekend and they are a little long.
Clarissa will let you know.
