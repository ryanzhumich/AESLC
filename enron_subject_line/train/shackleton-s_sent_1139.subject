Attached AS AN EXAMPLE ONLY is a "Transition Memo" which Marie prepared to  capture her current workload.
Could you please utilize that format and  prepare a summary of your current workload?
Mark, Carol and I would like to  receive your lists as soon as possible, but no later than Thursday evening.
Thanks.
Sara
