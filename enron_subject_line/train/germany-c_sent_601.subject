Effective immediately we are changing the way we handle deliveries to  Oglethorpe on Transco.
Current Process ENA sales gas to Oglethorpe at St 85 ENA buys gas from EPMI (deal 318335) at St 85 at Gas Daily ENA sells gas back to EPMI at Doyle Plant at Gas Daily plus variable cost.
New Process ENA sells gas to Oglethorpe at St 85 (deal 329314, baseload deal  and deal  318423, gas daily deal) ENA does an exchange buy (deal 338732) at St 85.
Curretly, this volume will  match the sale to Oglethorpe at St 85 ENA does an exchange sell (deal 338735), volume on this deal will be the  amount on deal 338732 less Z4 to Z4 fuel.
