Hi Peter:  I really appreciate your taking the time to interview me and I am very interested in the position.
Organizational ability is one of my strong points along with the fact that my length of service with Enron gives  me a great deal of knowledge in getting things done as  quickly as possible.
I really like setting things up and seeing the results come together quickly and efficiently.
I am a quick learner and a willing learner and feel that I would be able to assist you a great deal with the Estate.
If you have any other questions, please let me know.
Also, I know that Vince Kaminski would be willing to answer  any questions you might have.
Sincerely,
