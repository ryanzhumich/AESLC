Everyone,   There has been a major shakeup at TRW.
I have always  worked for TRW Automotive Electronics.
Well, we just got told that we TRW  AE has been dissolved and no longer exists.
I support the Safety  & Security, along with some Body Control plants.
Well, now I am  supposed to be going to the division known as Occupant Safety Systems (Airbags  & Seatbelts).
I am not sure what is going to  happen........   Laura
