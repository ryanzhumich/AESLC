Joe and David: Both Williams and Richardson Products have the typical confirmation process  language in their ISDA's where we send out the confirms and they have 3 days  to object.
The Williams Master is governed by NY law and Richardson by Texas  law so we are safer under the Williams Master if they are not signing.
With  respect to Morgan Stanley, we are the confirming party.
The Master was  amended to provide a procedure for them indicating their acceptance of the  confirm other than by signing it and it involves them sending us a letter  stating that they approve of the confirm.
I will send copies of the  amendment and letter to you.
Carol
