Activity levels in Credit Risk Management (CRM) have never been higher due to  very volatile commodity markets, growth in EES and many other factors.
In  order to address these market changes, effective now, Ken Curry will transfer  from Rick Carson's Due Diligence group to CRM and report to Bill Bradford.
Ken has a strong background in credit related issues and should be able to  immediately add value to the CRM group.
It is fortunate that adequate depth exists within RAC to be able to realign  personnel as market needs suggest.
Please join me in congratulating Ken on  his move and in wishing him success in this new assignment.
