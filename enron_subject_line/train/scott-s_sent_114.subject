See the attached.
Enron Corp. has already authorized Brian Cherry to add  Enron to the list of parties at the end of the document.
I recommend TW do  the same.
I propose that we ask Brian to add TW to the list, with a footnote  that we support the transmission proposal only and do not oppose the other  parts of the term sheet.
(I propose this out of an abundance of caution  because in one part of the document Brian states the parties have agreed on  comprehensive settlement, but later in the document he states that the  parties aren't fully committed yet.)
If he will not agree to do this, then I  would suggest we leave TW off the list and file a letter with the CPUC along  the lines of what I circulated yesterday, with additional language supporting  the motion for extension of time.
Let me know what you think.
