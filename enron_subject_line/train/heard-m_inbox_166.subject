Sarah:  Per my voice mail, attached is the "draft" guaranty for FIMAT (you have a hard copy).
I can't remember if I marked any other changes on ;your version that are not in the attachement.
I would let FIMAT know that Soc Gen just signed this version (except for the cap) in December, 2000.
I have a copy of it in my futures agreement file.
If you need any help finding this while I'm out, please call Marie Heard at X 33907.
