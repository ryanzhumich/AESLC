Vikas,  Attached are excel files for the different subsidiaries.
Each file has a tab  for the swap position and the option position.
For the options I have added  an auto filter at the top of the file so you can sort by strike price.
I  apologize for the delay, but I was trying to drop the info into an  appropriate format.
Thanks,
