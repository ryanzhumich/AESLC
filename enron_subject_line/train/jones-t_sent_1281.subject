Thanks for the nice note, I am the person that has the really neat yard that  was featured in the Chronicle, at least until this weekend when I bought and  moved into my new house.
I have a lot of work ahead of me yard wise.
This  yard has "great bones" but has been neglected for a long time.
Hopefully,  some day it will look as nice as the yard at my old house!
