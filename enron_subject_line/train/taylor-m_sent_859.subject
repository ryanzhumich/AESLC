Here is the revised list - there are several European entities that we showed  in our database so I have highlightedd them as well.
There were also several  from Friday's list that were still there so I have also bolded those.
I'll  try to track down what happened with those entities (Cinergy, DPL, NJ Nat  Gas, Niagara Mohawk & Washington Gas Light).
