I have received the list of CES agreements which George put together as  having Texas delivery points and have been attempting to put together a back  to back agreement similar to the back to back agreement which ENA has with  CES; however, I keep running into confidentially agreement problems.
I  understand that these CES agreements relate to June business and have no  deals and/or term beyond that point.
I suggest that the deliveries under  these agreements be documented as a GTC Confirmation between ENA and HPL and  thus avoid the confidentiality agreement problems.
George Weissman and Bob  Hall feel that this is a workable solution.
We will proceed with the  preparation of GTC's for each deal unless I hear otherwise.
