Mark,  I am sorry, but there seems to be a little confusion in our shop about who  your attorney should be on this deal.
I was given Andrew O'Connor's name,  and left him a message to which he finally responded.
He is now expecting to  see this CA.
I have now been given Wesley Fredericks name as your attorney.
I don't want to cause any conflict between attorneys, and wanted to get your  direction as to how I should handle this.
I am Tana Jones, and I am a paralegal in the Legal Department and my phone  number is 713/853-3399.
