Sabra,  I have extended the current FP&L sitara #217969 to the end of the deal (2/2010).
Keeping the same deal # helps us keep up with the value.
I set it up with the volumes we booked in TAGG, I know the volumes and locations will change but if you could send me and Yuan an e-mail when you have made your change during bid week we will make the changes to the hedge deal.
Thanks,
