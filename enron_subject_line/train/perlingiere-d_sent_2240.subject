Please take a final look at Section 13 as purposed by Northeast as they hav= e=20 changed the last sentence again!
Enron recognizes that, when NEGM is acting as Buyer hereunder, NEGM is=20 purchasing gas on behalf of certain gas companies (the =01&Repurchasers=018= ) to=20 whom it immediately resells such gas at the Delivery Point(s).
The parti= es=20 further agree that the term =01&Transporter=018 when used in this Contract,= =20 including, but not limited to, in Sections 4 and 11, shall include any=20 company acting in the capacity of a transporter for any Repurchaser and agr= ee=20 that Section 4.3 of the Contract will apply to invoices from such=20 Transporters for Imbalance Charges received from such Transporters to the= =20 same extent as if such invoices were received by NEGM provided, that any su= ch=20 Repurchaser  scheduled and nominated the same volumes as Enron and NEGM=20 scheduled and nominated on hehalf  of  such  Repurchaser at the Delivery=20 Point(s).
