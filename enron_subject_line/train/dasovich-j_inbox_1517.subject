I think I left my email open at home which means I can't download it on Omnisky or Yahoo.
So you can email me at this address if you need to.
Will you get stuff for breakfast at Rainbow?
Eggs Butter Bread for toast Jarly or cheddar Porties or other mushrooms Green onions  Don't buy any yellow onions - I will bring some from home.
I love you.
