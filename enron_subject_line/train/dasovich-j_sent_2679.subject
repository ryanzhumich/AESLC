Here are some suggestions for the op-ed piece.
One general comment:  It may  be a bit lengthy at this point.
Also, have we decided whether it would be  our op-ed piece?
And one key point that is very commercially sensitive:  The term "end the  rate freeze" has very ominous implications for EES's book, depending on the  timing of any such "end" in California.
Thus my heavy-handed edits on that  portion.
Nice job, Jeannie.
Best,
