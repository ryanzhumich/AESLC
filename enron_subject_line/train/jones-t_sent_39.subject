Just an FYI  About a year ago Kellie Metcalf had me send a sample ISDA Master to the  referenced counterparty.
She has now left ECT to go with Azurix.
I got a  call from the counterparty wanting to get some bids on some options and  Kellie said to pass the trade down to John Suarez.
I called John and gave  him the scoop and also told him we did not have a master in place and to  treat this like any other counterparty, i.e.
contact Credit for approvals  before trading, etc.
I just wanted to give you a head's up, in case we get  the trade, we're not surprised.
