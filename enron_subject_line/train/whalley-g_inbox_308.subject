We are prepared to file the Hart-Scott-Rodino ("HSR") Form with the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice on Tuesday, Nov. 13th.
I have received the necessary statutory notice from Dynegy that was a prerequisite to our filing.
Please confirm to me that since Friday, Nov. 12th, we have not prepared any additional HSR Item 4(c) documents in connection with the proposed merger or Northern Natural Gas transactions with Dynegy.
Item 4(c) requires the parties to the filings to provide to the FTC and to the DOJ the following:  "all studies, surveys, analyses and reports which were prepared by or for any officer(s) or director(s) (or, in the case of unincorporated entities, individuals exercising similar functions) for the purpose of evaluating or analyzing the acquisition with respect to market shares, competition, competitors, markets, potential for sales growth or expansion into product or geographic markets..."  Please also circulate this E-Mail to any other member of the Working Group who may have knowledge or possession of any Item 4(c) documents.
Thanks for your help!
