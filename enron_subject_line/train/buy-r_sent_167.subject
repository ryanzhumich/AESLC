Spoke with John Sherriff this am re prc for London RAC people.
John said they  included our people for cross calibration purposes but we could rank our  people where we saw fit.
So I don't think there is any issue here.
The  Houston PRC rankings should stand unless there was new information brought to  light to you Steve that calls into question a person's ranking.
Sheila- please double check with the London HR people that this is  straightened out.
Thanks, Rick
