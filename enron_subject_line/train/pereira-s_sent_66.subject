Helen-  I don't think we will be able to do group lessons during the week, but, just  for grins, what is the time of the Tuesday afternoon class?
How many kids  are in the class and who is the instructor?
Also, are there any group  lessons on the weekends that my daughter Kali might participate in?
Are the  classes large?
Thanks,
