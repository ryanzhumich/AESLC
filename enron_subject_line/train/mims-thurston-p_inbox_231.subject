Hi Vonda   Even though, I know I'll probably be at a disadvantage because of my notification deadline, I'll try again on the S. Texas piece.
If my memory serves me right, you were looking for a daily call option on the S.Texas piece.
Enron offers the following:    Period:				November, 2001 - March, 2002  Region:				Trunkline South Texas Pool  Volume:			10,000 MMBtu/d  Demand Charge:		$0.0425 per MMBtu for the above referenced time period times 				the volume, for the right to receive the volumes on a daily 				basis at the Trunkline S. Texas " Gas Daily Daily" price.
Notification Time:		7:30 a.m.
Thanks
