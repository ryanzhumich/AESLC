Diane:  Attached are my revisions to the form of confirmation (which are NOT on the  actual confirms you will be using).
You will need to incorporate the section  entitled "Additional Provisions" and you will also need to add the Exhibit A  guaranty.
Please let me (and Mark Beese) review before this is sent.
Please  call if you have questions.l
