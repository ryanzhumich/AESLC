As you may or may not be aware of, tomorrow is the drop dead date for  approval of the referenced new product for our existing approved counterparty  list.
Thinking through this product today and reading through my various  emails from David Minns, I have come to the conclusion that there are no  particular issues specifically relating to Australian financial power, and my  thinking is to just mirror the approval for some other previously approved  financial power product.
I can't, obviously, speak for you, but it seems to  me that that should work for your counterparty lists too.
What do you think?
The list I am working off of is the list generated for Credit Derivative  approvals (which is the most somewhat current list of counterparties who have  been issued passwords).
