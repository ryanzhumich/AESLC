I think all of us who deal with assets are running across confidentiality  hurdles in all kinds of agreements, including confidentiality agreements.
In  short, our business people need the ability to disclose agreements to  potential purchasers of projects, contracts and assets, and not all of our  forms allow this.
I'm trying to include an exception for "potential lenders and investors"  whenever I can (instead of just lenders).
Does someone have a more artful or  effective solution?
Just wanted to share the thought so that more eyes could be watching for the  issue.
