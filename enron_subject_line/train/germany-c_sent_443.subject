I just entered a commodity rate on deal 299159.
It has very big volumes on  it each month and there has not been a commodity rate on it.
Joanne just  verified that this is regular transport, not Dayton or CALP.
This will be a  big OA variance for June - August.
This deal is for deliveries to Storage.
Would you verify if ACA and GRI are  billed for storage deliveries please?
