Please note that Mark Dilworth's demonstration scheduled for tomorrow morning  (11:00 EB2601a) will not be of the entire EnronOnline system but will focus  on the portion of the system that builds the long descriptions.
The system  now builds the entire long description from the various elements - most of  which we have already reviewed - and displays them as they will be viewed by  counterparties online.
It is particularly important that the lawyers  responsible for the long descriptions and the GTC's attend so that we can  complete the review process.
If you can not attend, please let me know so we  can set up a time for Mark to show you how to access the system.
Thanks,
