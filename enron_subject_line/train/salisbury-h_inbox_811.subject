I will be holding an information session on the midyear PRC process.
The purpose of the information session is to provide an overview of the PRC process from selecting reviewers to final PRC meetings in Houston.
New employees may find it useful as I will try to explain how the process works and will attempt to provide some useful background.
People who have been here for a while may also find it useful.
This year I am on the company-wide Performance Review Committee, so I have had the opportunity to provide input into the process and sit in on PRC meetings throughout the company.
I will discuss changes to this year's PRC process and share my observations of how the system works throughout the company.
Most importantly, I want to answer any questions that people have about the PRC process.
