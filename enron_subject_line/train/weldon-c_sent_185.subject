Doug,  This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating  that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged  to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.
According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM  method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).
Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.
Charlie
