For those of you who didn't have the patience/patriotism to listen to your  president for the whole hour and a half last night, let me share a  highlight:  Clinton announced a new $1 billion program for economic  development on the reservations.
Langley may be onto something.
If he/we  can get the first deal done in New Mexico and assuming Gore wins, there may  be opportunities to replicate the deal elsewhere.
I'm thinking of tribal  lands in Minnesota, Wisconsin, S. Dakota, etc.
Perhaps Bill should call  Chairman Ken and talk to him about changing sides.
Notice that I'm not  volunteering to make that phone call.
