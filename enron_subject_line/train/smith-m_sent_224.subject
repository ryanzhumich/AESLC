Mike,  Sorry I missed you guys Friday night.
I made back from a golf outing around  9 pm, but you guys must have already left the Front Porch.
Anyway,  I was  out the other night and met some Dynegy talent that were interested in an  Enron Analyst/Associate and Dynegy Pace Program happy hour.
What do you  think about the prospectsof a combined happy hour.
They have a group that  goes out on the third Thursday of every month, which would be this Thursday.
