Here's the original note that I sent about the bill (yours and ms cameron's)  that ended up on my bill.
************************************************************************ Hi.
I've got all the paperwork.
The bill (on my bill) for you guys is $740.
I'll get you the paperwork tonite.
Sorry for the mix-up  (should I ask Squaw for a discount due to all the mess!?!?
).
