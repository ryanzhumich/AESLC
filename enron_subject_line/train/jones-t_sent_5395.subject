On the attached list:  CMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company:  Credit is opening them up for  Can & US gas, which I am fine with.
I already had them open for financial.
Make sure they're shut down for physical power.
Westpac:  I just approved that one on the 1/5/01 list.
There should be no  changes from that list.
Enron Australia has an ISDA Master in place with  them, as does ENA, so we are OK with them transacting all financial,  including all Australia financial.
