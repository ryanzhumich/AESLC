Per my conversation this morning with the lawyer at NYPA, they would like to  transact business on a going forward basis under the attached form of what we  consider an "ISDA Confirmation" (it seemed to me their lawyer thought this  document was a sufficient ISDA Master).
Sara has a call into him to get his  thoughts about this document  Per my conversations w/Sara, we would like to  get our standard governmental form of ISDA Master in place.
We wonder what  your thoughts are on his document.
Further, he seemed quite firm that they  would not be issuing a legal opinion, but would give us a certified copy of  the resolution I am about to fax to you.
We look forward to getting your  comments.
