Jeremy,  Currently, all of our index deals are in the FT-WEST book.
I would like to  move them all to the GD-NEW book.
I don't want to change any price or basis  portions of a deal currently in the FT-WEST book, only index.
Please let me  know if you can do this.
If you have any further questions, please call.
Thanks.
