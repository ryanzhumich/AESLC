Jaime: I spoke with our counsel in Mexico today and they are beginning the process  of analyzing the online issues for us.
I hope to be able to have a call with  me, you and them sometime next week where we can answer whatever questions  they have and maybe get a preliminary indication from them as to what our  online issues may be.
Who from the online side should I involve?
Alos, are  there any days next week in which you would not be available?
Could you alos  e-mail me with your direct phone number and fax number?
Our counsel's name  is Jose Raz-Guzman.
