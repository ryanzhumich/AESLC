Mark: Just 2 thoughts on the new draft:  1.
In the definition of Global Early Termination Date, how does this work  with the new Section 16 concept that Alicia has added to the Schedules  whereby the termination of Transactions that raise Section 16 problems may be  delayed?
2.
Does Section 5.06 conflict at all with the proviso in the Limitation of  Liability sections of both Schedules?
