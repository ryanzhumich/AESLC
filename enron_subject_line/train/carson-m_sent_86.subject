Wus up!!
Just wondering if you give me directions from BWI to our  accomidations on the base??
I will be arriving at BWI @ 12 noon.
I rented a  car ,and I am driving down to DC.
I will then take a cab from the base to  the pentagon ,,,, I guess.
Can't wait to see you , Jan , and the kids!
MC  perge!
