I asked Mike this week if your baby was here, and he said that you had just  returned to the office.
Congratulations on the birth of your little girl.
I  hope that all three of you are surviving those first few weeks of adjustment  and that sleep is not too short a commodity in your house!
I will look  forward to seeing pictures of Lauren when I am next in London.
You do know  that now that you are a dad that it is a requirement to be armed with  adorable pictures at all times?
