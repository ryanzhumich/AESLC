This is a good time to bring this up.
Unless the original CES agreement has  changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000  - 4/30/2000.
From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand  charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.
Which brings up 2 important points;  1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss  this with CALP (and she may have already)      However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.
2.
It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.
