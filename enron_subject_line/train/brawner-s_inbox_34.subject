To all,  I visited with Kam earlier today to revisit the positions in the SE book and we discovered the following:  City of Madison transport:	transfer to Pete's book for 10/01 and forward MGAF transport:		write down 2007-2020 position.
Loss of about $500K - Scott as we spoke, I'll take the blame LRC/Stringray positions:		Kam to review and explain Annuity:				Origination total of about 90K, net with 500 loss from above Alagasco:			Tammi deal, Sonat Tier 2 position Others:				As I explained to Kam, any gain from closing this book should be transferred for the 				account of Jared Kaiser 				 	      Bank of America 					      ABA 0011.....just kidding!
It comes from sitting by Sandra too long.
Kam - thanks for your help and let me know if you need my help.
As well, please reply if I have not covered all issues.
