Do you think that we should give Susan B., Susan F.  and Tana an expression  of thanks for their work during Marie's departure?
I was thinking that a  gift certificate would be appropriate (e.g., spa services, Enron gift  products, etc.)
and it might send the message that we do know and appreciate  their efforts.
