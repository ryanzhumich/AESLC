Dan,  I work for Tom Martin on the Texas Gas Trading Desk and he has some questions  on EOL "Force Majeure" language.
Specifically, we buy/sell gas at the Exxon  Katy Plant and were wondering the "Force Majeure" ramifications of the the  Plant closing due to freeze-offs, i.e.
can we claim Force Majeure in that  instance and what remedies are provided for in the EOL contract language?
Additionally, we buy/sell gas at HPL pooling points such as Agua Dulce Pool  and were curious about the Force Majeure provisions and remedies for these  pooling zones.
I do not know if you are the right person to contact regarding this  information, but if you can provide any insight I would greatly appreciate it.
Thanks in advance.
Sincerely,
