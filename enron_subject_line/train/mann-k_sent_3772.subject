In speaking with Lee Johnson this am, he mentioned that he is still missing  final contracts for PSCO and CA Development.
I seem to recall that Sheila  had asked someone to pull this together, and that I had given Kathleen the CA  Development stuff.
I could be off track, but that's how I remember it.
There's probably someone with a better memory.
Thoughts?
Thanks,
