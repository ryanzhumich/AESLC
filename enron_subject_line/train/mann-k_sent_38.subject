ABB is struggling with a fundamental assignment issue.
Their concern appears  to relate to assignment to a project company or contractor which might not  have the financial ability to pay.
I believe they are looking for some type  of security (LC, bond, guaranty).
I didn't sense that they have an issue  with the identity of the assignee, just the ability to pay.
Comments?
