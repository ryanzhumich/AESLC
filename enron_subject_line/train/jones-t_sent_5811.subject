This counterparty came thru on 2/28/01 list.
I checked my database and we  had them open for power sales only on the pre-approval list.
When I checked  Profile Manager, it had them open for east & west power, transact on BOTH the  bid and offer.
Do you still want them to do power sales only?
Both east &  west?
