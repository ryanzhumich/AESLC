Attached is the template settlement agreement for the EPMI assignment transactions.
Bill and Tanya, can we get an updated copy of the transaction list (I think you may have identified some additional transactions since you ran the copy that I have in front of me).
Bill, has anyone discussed with you the "message" that these transactions may be sending to counterparties ...  you have probably already discussed this with Louise and John and others, but if not, we may want to make sure we are on the same page as to communications with counterparties before we get the ball rolling.
