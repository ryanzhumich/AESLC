Here are the results of Week 10.
Growney took 1st place; Conna came in 2nd; and  Andy and Ken tied for third.
It was  a  high-scoring week with a total of 2,590 points.
Congratulations to Donna and Ken,  their first time in the money.
I'm sending checks out for the whole half-season.
Let me know if you don't get yours next week, just in case you've moved and  I don't have the right address.
