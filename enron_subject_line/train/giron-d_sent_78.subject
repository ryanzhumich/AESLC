Instead of sending $ in and pulling $ out every month, I am going to stop  sending $ into the CMA account starting this month.
I actually have already  done this on the web.
What I need you to do is to stop the monthly purchase  of APGCX for $340 begining this month.
Also, any idea if I am going to  receive a 1099 for the recharacterization of the IRAs?
I noticed online  that  the Roths are now zero.
Thanks.
DG
