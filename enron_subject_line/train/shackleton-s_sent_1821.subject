All:  (1)  Please provide the name of the Enron party to this agreement.
If  it is the London credit group, we need to verify authority to execute.
I  never heard back from Paul Simons.
(2)  What is the priority?
I think we are waiting to hear back from Mike  because we have had a conversation with the BuySideDirect people and can give  an additional explanation.
