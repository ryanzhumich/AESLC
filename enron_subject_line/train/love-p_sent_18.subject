Could you please change the curve mappings on a type of trade for Robyn  Menear.
THe trade is a GD Index swap for out months.
THe product type is US  GAS Basis - GD/M Trunk WLA.
This is currently being mapped to a GDP curve  adn we need it changed to TRUNKL/WLA-GD.
Robyn sets this curve everyday as a  basis curve.
Thanks.
If you have any questions or concerns, please feel  free to shout.
