The Republicans are currently on the Senate floor arguing (noisily,  repeatedly and passionately) that California (and the Senate in particular)  is being hypocritical and intellectually dishonest in attacking and  investigating private companies and ignoring munis.
One Senator specifically identified prices charged by LADWP and SMUD and  compared those prices to Enron's (1/3 to 1/2 less than LADWP and SMUD  charged).
Best,
