David and Louise: One of the things that Organic has asked us to keep confidential is "the  existence of any business discussions, negotiations or agreements between the  parties as well as any information regarding the skills and compensation of  employees, contractors or other agents of the disclosing party."
This is a  departure from our form.
Are we prepared to agree to this?
Also, to the  extent that parties are insisting on using their form of CA, what do you want  the approval process to be?
