The lenders would like a list of the potential producers in Bolivia for  Cuiaba I and if info is available on their holdings please provide that as  well.
Can we also give the details of the Vintage transaction as an example  of our capabilities?
If their consent is required can you obtain?
KFW is ok on relying solely on the back-up fuel supply support but OPIC is  not there yet.
Also, KFW is offering to allow us to go back to floating on interest rate.
They will provide the cost within the next 24 hours, but they have indicated  that it will be significantly less than US$250,000 for a current estimated  annual savings of 60 bps.
This sounds like a good move to me.
