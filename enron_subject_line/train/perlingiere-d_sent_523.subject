Venona,   I have discussed the warranty issue with my attorney and he suggested the  following be used as Section 8.5.
The language in this section allows for  gas from outside the state.
Please advise.
The following representations and warranties shall apply to Transactions  under the stated conditions:  (i) if Company is Buyer, Seller represents and  warrants to Buyer that all Gas will have been produced (a) within the state  of Texas and will not have been commingled with other Gas which is or may be  sold, consumed, transported or otherwise utilized in interstate commerce in  such manner which would subject an intrastate Transporter to the jurisdiction  of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or any successor authority under  the Natural Gas Act of 1938 or (b) outside of the state of Texas with any  transportation on an interstate pipeline having been conducted under Section  311 (a)(1) of the Natural Gas Policy Act and (ii) if Company is Seller and  the Delivery Point(s) for the Transaction are not interstate  interconnections, Buyer represents and warrants to Seller that none of the  Gas will be sold, consumed, transported or otherwise utilized outside the  state or sold to another party which will subsequently sell, consume,  transport or otherwise use the Gas outside the State where such event would  subject an intrastate Transporter to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission or any successor authority under the Natural Gas Act of  1938.
