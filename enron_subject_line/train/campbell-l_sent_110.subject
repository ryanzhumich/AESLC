Guys, look at the attached draft of a letter I plan on sending to the Laguna  pueblo regarding Transwestern efforts to date of finding new technologies to  address and remove PCB contamination from the groundwater at the facility.
You may remember, we had a meeting in January to hear the Laguna's concerns  that Transwestern was not moving fast enough to clean up the site.
This  letter addresses our attempts to find a solution to the PCB problem, and that  remediation technologies are not presently available to operate effectively  at the site given the sites unique characterisstics.
Id like to send this  out on Friday or Monday.
