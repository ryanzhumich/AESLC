I started a spreadsheet for us to keep track of our books, traders, file names, etc.
It is saved in O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\Controls\Trader Matrix.xls  Please add any other fields you think we should have.
Jeff mentioned he wants to be able to quickly tell what books belong to what traders, O'neil had this idea.
Is everyone ready to start setting up their books today?
Has Scott Neal gotten back to you yet Phillip?
