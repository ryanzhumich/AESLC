To my surprise, I was chosen today to sit on a jury to hear a felony charge.
The judge believes that we can conclude the trial by end of the day on  Wednesday or perhaps on Thursday.
I will be back here working after trial  hours in the office and checking voice mail messages during breaks in the  proceedings.
I will be back full time as soon as my civic duty is  fulfilled!
Enron is well presented in the court system over the next few days.
I sat by  Mark Koenig in the jury assembly room today, and he too was chosen to serve  on another jury.
