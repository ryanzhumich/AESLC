All:  Before Rod became a Brit, we were working with Enron Corp. treasury to  put in place some masters in the name of ENA for the following parties:  Bear, Stearns Internaitonal Limited Credit Agricole Indosuez CSFB International Lehman Brother Finance S.A. Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc. Deutsche Bank  These masters will be used to for equity deals on ENE stock.
The Treasury  group has concluded together with Rex Rogers and V&E, that Enron Corp. is the  appropriate swap counterparty for these masters and NOT ENA.
Who in credit will be available to assist me in this process?
Thanks.
Sara
