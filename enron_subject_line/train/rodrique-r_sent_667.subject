The Gas Spec (Oil NG Hedge) book will show a MTD variance of $819,000 today.
When the Power p&l was added to this book last week the formulas did not  divide by 1,000.
Therefore the incorrect p&l was reported.
However, John  Lavorato was given a corrected report, so this variance will not be included  in today's daily p&l on the NGP&L.
If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.
Thanks,
