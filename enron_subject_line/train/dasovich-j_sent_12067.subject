Anything can happen, but Hedy just talked to the Executive Offficer of the  Senate Rules committee who told her that it is very unlikely that the full  Senate would vote on any contempt report before the Senate leaves for recess;  that is, they likely wouldn't vote on anything until they return in August.
Other info from the conversation: With respect to fines, sanctions, etc., he said that "they're making it up as  they go."
Any vote on fines, etc.
would only a require a simple majority to pass.
