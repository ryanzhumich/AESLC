Maria: Could you please send me a redline of the Guaranty Agreements and LC (either  by fax or e-mail) that crosses through and/or underlines the changes that  were made?
Also, please send me a redline (either by fax or e-mail) of both  the CSA (when it is ready) and ISDA Schedules that underlines or crosses  through the changes that were made so that I can sign off on this.
The fax  that I received did not indicate all chnages that were made in this way.
Thanks.
