Brant: There is one issue that is left to resolve.
In the CSA, we define  independent amount as any amount specified for a party in any Confirmation or  if no amount is specified, 0.
They wnat to either delete this entirely or  add language requiring some type of notice to the credit dept.
of the party  that has to put up the independent amount before it becomes effective.
What  do you want to do?
