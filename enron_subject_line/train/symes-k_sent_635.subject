Please note an addition to the daily EOL summary.
Two new tables delineate  each desk's year-to-date trades, in addition to the month-to-date and daily  trade tables usually included in the report.
Feel free to let me know if you  find this data helpful, harmful, or not even worthy of note.
Thanks,
