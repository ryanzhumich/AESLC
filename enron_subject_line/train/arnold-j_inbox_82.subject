Brian,  As we discussed earlier today, Enron North America Corp. (ENA) desires to re-establish its account with Paribas.
The purpose of this account would be to sell no more than 2,500 NYMEX natural gas futures contracts to hedge natural gas storage inventory for the months of February, March and April, 2002.
Please advise me as soon as possible regarding what ENA will need to do to re-establish its account.
Please call me with questions at (w) 713-853-7657 or (m) 713-582-8379.
Regards,
