Sarah: I am a friend of Trina Chandler's and am currently looking for a full time  nanny to take care of my 4 month old.
Trina mentioned to me that you had a  temp a few months ago that was looking for a full time position.
Do you know  if she is still available?
If so, please call me at home at 281-890-7122 or  e-mail me.
If you know of anyone else that may be looking for a job, please  keep me in mind.
How did you find your nanny?
Carol
