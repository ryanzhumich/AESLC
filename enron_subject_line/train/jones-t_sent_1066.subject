Just to give a head's up,  In case I'm not here and you have to get something signed for EnronOnline,  Louise Kitchen absolutely does not want any other officer signing documents  for her group.
The only two signatories for EnronOnline are Louise and Andy  Zipper, Vice President.
FYI, we do have a resolution in place that allows  certain individuals to sign password applications (only!)
on behalf of  EnronOnline.
