Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.
The next phase of  the office construction project will begin in a little over a week.
There is  good news and bad news.
First the bad: the office which you currently occupy  will be in the next construction phase.
Now the good:  it looks like we  will probably have a place for you to sit until your new office is ready.
Taffy Milligan will submit the move request (for next Friday - Jan. 12) and  will have details directly.
Your assistants can help you order boxes and  arrange your move.
