I just set up all the deal tickets for the CGAS New Power storage contract  for Nov-Mar.
We believe our agency relationship with New Power will end  effective March 31, 2001.
The deal numbers are on the attached worksheet.
I entered the following deals at a zero commodity 470563  Buy exchange 470582  Sell Cpr Storage  470587 Buy CPR Storage 470568 Sell exchange   I added about 7500 dth to deal 456379 for November and I extended it through  March 31.
I'm kinda sleepy so I probably made a few mistakes.
