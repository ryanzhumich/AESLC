Willie - Per our conversation - the West Power desk needs three new settlement indices  for entering swaps deals in EnPower.
The indices are as follows:  Last day settle for MIDC NYMEX contract Last 5-day average for PALO VERDE NYMEX contract Last 5-day average for COB NYMEX contract  Please let me know if you have any questions.
The first index is a little  more pressing than the other two - one of our traders did a futures deal a  week ago which we have yet to swap from his book to the one it belongs in.
We  can't execute the swap until we have a MIDC settlement index.
Thank you so much for your help.
