As we move forward in the planning stages for NETCO we need to identify all systems which need to be moved or copied into the entity.
We have identified the great majority of the systems to be moved but we may not be able to identify particular tools used by your group or you individually.
This would include spreadsheets etc.
Please send lists of systems and software required to Anne Koehler by close of business today.
To be clear we can (subject to the negotiation) move/copy systems and some data however, we CANNOT move either transaction data if counterparty specific or data obtained from a counterparty under a confidentiality agreement.
For Houston traders, Geof Storey is compiling your lists.
Thanks
