FERC's meeting scheduled for Wednesday, November 7, does not have any RTO dockets on the agenda.
The generic docket "Electricity Market Design and Structure," which is the docket FERC is using for its "RTO Week" proceeding, is included on the agenda, but we do not expect any significant actions in this docket because FERC is still taking comments from the industry on the outcome of RTO Week.
However, this new Commission has surprised us before, so if anything of import happens at next week's meeting, we'll notify you immediately.
Please let us know if you have any questions.
