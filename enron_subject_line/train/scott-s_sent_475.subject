The apartment complex needs for you to fax them a statement saying you are no  longer living in our apartment and they need it by tomorrow morning.
If I  don't here from you via email/msngr  by the end of tonight I'm going to forge  one and fax it to them.
Actually, I can do that regardless if you don't  mind.
Just drop me a line and let me know what works for you.
Hope things are going well.
I actually worked 21 straight hours the other  day/night (7:45 am Tuesday until 4:45 am Wednesday)...I think this  constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.
