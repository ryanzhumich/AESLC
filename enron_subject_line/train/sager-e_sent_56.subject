Mark  Attached is the draft memo.
After you have had a chance to review, please  call me with your thoughts/comments.
I would also like to briefly speak with  John Klauberg about "East Coast" municipalities to make sure he thinks this  policy works in the east as well.
John is going to call me early this  afternoon.
Also, to the extent you think we should highlight financial  trading policies like I have done, I would like Mark to review what is  written (he did confirm that this is financial trading's policy).
Finally,  it would be very helpful if I could get your thoughts on to whom we should  distribute the memo.
Thanks
