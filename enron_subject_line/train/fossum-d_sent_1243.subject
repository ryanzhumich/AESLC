Congratulations Adam, and welcome to ETS to both of you!!
You guys may not  have heard this, but Mike Moran is retiring and I'm taking over for him as  general counsel of the ETS organization.
Does this all mean that I'm your  lawyer again just like in the old Zond days???
Weird.
Good luck and best  wishes!
