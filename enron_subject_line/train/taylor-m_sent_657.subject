I'm not sure which e-mail address you are using so I figured I'd send to both.
Here is my itinerary for Christmas travel:  Friday 12/24    Continental 4126  Leaves Houston 7:55 am  Arrives Cincinnati  11:20 am Sunday 12/26  Continentat 4122  Leaves Cincinnati 5:45 pm  Arrives Houston  7:25 pm  These are Continental Express flights - I don't know if that makes a  difference in terminals in Cincinnati or not - it does in Houston.
I got your message at home, my SSN is *********
