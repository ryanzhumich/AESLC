I just received a call from Nancy Bagot informing me that FERC has issued a  draft order suspending our proposed Transport Options tariff sheets until May  1, 2001 and accepting them subject to the outcome of a technical conference.
The technical conference is to take place within 120 days of the order and  will address issues raised in protests.
I should be receiving a copy of the draft order soon.
Please call or e-mail  me if you have questions.
