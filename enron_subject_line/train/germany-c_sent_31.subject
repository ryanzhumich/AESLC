I believe ENA is still agent for Columbia Energy Services and Columbia Energy  Marketing on several pipelines.
Rich Contos's (the only CES person I know)  last day is this Friday.
I left Rich a voicemail asking him if CES/CEM  should continue to exist as a legal entity on the pipelines.
As ENA, I believe I sould at least begin terminating the agency (and  liability) relationships.
Comments/questions?
?
