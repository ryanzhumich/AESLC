Steve & Christian,  After talking with the Southwest desk here is what is happening with Azusa.
Deal #831407.1 Paloverde Heavy Load 10mw Purchase from Azusa at $32.50  1/1/02 thru 3/31/02  Deal #537901.1 Paloverde Heavy Load 10mw Sale to Azusa at $139.00         1/1/02 thru 12/31/02  	These two deals are the only ones active for January  and are being performed on.
They are booked out financially.
All other deals I found are for Q3 '02 and beyond.
I hope this clarifies some things.
