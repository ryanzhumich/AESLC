Edmund Cooper just called and wanted to know what form changes we have made  as a result of the new CFTC Rules.
I told him we just met on that yesterday,  and as soon as we revised the form, we would send it to London.
Also, if  there will be any changes in our advice to the traders resulting from this,  please let him and he will disseminate the information to London Legal.
