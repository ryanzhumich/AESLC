Guys, attached you will find a list of key transactions identified in the Hot  List for each business unit.
The performance of your group is key to making  our targets for Q4 and to meet budgeted origination performance for the  year.
Independent of specific budgets for the groups, the origination  organization needs to generate $250M for Q4.
Ultimately, a strong  performance in Q4 by the origination organization will help build momentum  into the year-end PRC.
I will be setting up time with each of you to go through your numbers and  specifics on the deals.
Regards
