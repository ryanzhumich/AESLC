Scott/Cameron:    OK, wondering why there ain't no charges on your credit card from our  FABULOUS trip to Squaw Valley?
I just found out that they're all on  mine!!?!?!?
I had the best time up there, but I couldn't figure out how it  coulda cost $1700.
Just called them to inquire.
They said:  There's no  mistake those are all the carges for rooms 432 and 450.
They're sending  receipts.
Unreal.
Best,

@subject
Merry Xmas?
