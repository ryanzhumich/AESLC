Sally / Bill / Shawn  This is a quick note to let you know that as of Monday 1 October Enron Europe will be introducing a robust New Account Opening Policy for all trading counterparties.
The Operational Credit team will be responsible for ensuring the smooth roll-out of the policy and for ensuring compliance with it.
The salient points of the policy are that:  traders will be more accountable for relevant Regulatory and internal compliance concerning their counterparties; money laundering checks will be completed for all new counterparties prior to trading; the Compliance Group will give sign off for all new counterparties prior to trading; RAC will give sign off for all new counterparties prior to trading.
These controls are already in place for the majority of Enron Europe's counterparties, however, the introduction of the Policy enables us to demonstrate this more effectively to the Regulators and to monitor compliance more easily.
I attach the policy below.
If you have any questions pls give me a call on +44 7783 5261.
Thanks   -   Sam
