Congratulations to you and Lanettte on the birth of Nicole Mackenzie.
What a  pretty name!
I was in London last week and got the news while I was there.
I hope that everyone in your household is doing well, although I know that  you are probably a bit sleep deprived.
That will pass - although with your  first one that is really hard to believe.
Please stop by as soon as you have  pictures.
I would love to see them.
