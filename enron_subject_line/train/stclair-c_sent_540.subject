Mark and Jeff: Trina and i talked about the issue that you raised with me today.
Our  preference is to structure the language so that it would only trigger an  Event of Default under the Swap if the Enron merger caused an Event of  Default under the Revolver.
At the end of the day, we both felt that this is  a call that someone on the commercial side should make, such as either Ben  Glisan or Mike Jakubik.
