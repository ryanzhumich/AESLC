In the interest of moving things forward, it would help if you could provide the following info:  1.
Hand-marked copy of the portions of the current contract which need to be changed.
2.
A brief description of the new deal, especially the index language.
I know VEPCO may be preparing a first draft, but I think it would be good to get some focus ahead of time.
