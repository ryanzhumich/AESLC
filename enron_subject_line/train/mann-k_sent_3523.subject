I have a 300 meeting, so I'm sending this as is so that David can print a  copy.
I have not yet integrated all of his changes, although I have dealt  with the profit/savings and QSE.
Is the scope of scheduling services in the exhibit the same as the Scheduling  (aka QSE) stuff?
Later,  Kay  ps Reagan has the latest exhibits.
