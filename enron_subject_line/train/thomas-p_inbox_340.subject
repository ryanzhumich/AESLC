Hey Paul, how is it going??
Attached you'll  find some of the pics from the halloween party.
I hope you like  them.
I'm going to Brasil today!!!
Just for 4 days, I guess  it's better than nothing.
Let's do something when I get back.
Our  weekends have been pretty laid back lately.
We miss you guys!!!
