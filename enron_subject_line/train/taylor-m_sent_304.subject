Jeff:  In preparation for his meetings with Commissioner Newsome and Congressman  Stenholm, Mark H. has asked for  information including a bullet point list of  our key issues and any appropriate background material.
I have prepared a  draft issues list which is attached.
Would you please take a quick look at  it and see if there is anything you think should be added and then forward it  on to Mark?
He probably also needs the final itineraries.
Thanks for your  help.
Mark T.
