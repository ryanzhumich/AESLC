The place (outside) is a mess and needs some clean-up (e.g., get all that old  wood out of the front yard, whack down the weeds).
Possible for you guys to  come up next Wednesday night and we can do a quick clean up on Thursday.
I'm  going to try to hire a hauling company to help us and haul it away.
If  Cameron has to work are you available?
Best,
