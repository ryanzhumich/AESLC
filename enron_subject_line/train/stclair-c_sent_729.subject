Molly: Here is a draft letter for Statoil.
Under the Master, they have a 1 Business  Day cure period after they receive notice from us of their failure to post  collateral before we can declare an event of Default.
Please call me to  discuss after you have had a chance to decide what you want to do.
Carol
