Just for everyone's information - I've entered two buys from Seattle City  Light to negate an earlier sale of power to the company (Deal 317868).
The  deals are as follows:  515404 STCA buys SCL 2/8/01-2/28/01 SP-15 Off Peak $115.00  515420 LTCA buys SCL 3/1/01-3/31/01 SP-15 Off Peak $115.00  I'm giving you this disclaimer either because you asked me to enter the deal,  the deal is in your book, or the deal will affect your calc.
The volume is  shaped between 1 and 2 MW.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
