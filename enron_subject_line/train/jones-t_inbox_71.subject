Tana,   The suite of offices on 29 will be complete with a fax machine and an additional analog line for P.C.
dial-up access by close of business today.
The only exception to your requirements is for an additional table in the empty room.
I believe that will be in by mid day tomorrow.
We will prepare 32 Thursday.
