Per our discussion when I was in London, we ordered you  a box of blue files  and sent them to you (for your original deal files since you said you  couldn't get those types of files in England).
One of our assistants got a  call from what I guess must be Meagan and she (Meagan) said she was sending  the files back because it wasn't what she wanted.
So if you do want the blue  files you might want to intervene with Meagan before the files cross the  Atlantic again.
We would, of course, be able to use the files here, so no  big deal.
