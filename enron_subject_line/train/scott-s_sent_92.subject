The Commercial Group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer  than a 3-month period.
This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily  firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for  consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.
The discount letter, on the  other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a  certain period of time (typically one month).
Steve Harris wants to be able  to "sell daily firm for a one-year period."
In contractual terms all this  would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual),  and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.
I  see no problem with this, do you?
(Apparently the current perception in  marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month  period.)
