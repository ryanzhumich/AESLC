Mark asked me to contact you to get a copy of one of the letters we sent to  outside counsel requesting updates on their legal advice to deal with the  online trading issues.
We have to get similar letters out to some of the  South American countries and Carribean tax shelter islands.
Much thanks!
By the way, weren't you out for vacation?
Did you have a good  time?
