It appears you missed some cpys on the referenced list because Tom had the  freeze panel button on, and you probably didn't see them at first.
I didn't  either until I clicked on the down button and they popped up.
When you have  a minute, I'll give me a call and I'll come around and show you how to  unfreeze the panel.
