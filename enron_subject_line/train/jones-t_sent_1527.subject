No divisions should be opened up without the legal name as part of the title  of the account, or the confirms will not go out right.
You have two on the  7/14/00 list, TXU Gas Distribution, a division of TXU Gas Company, and  Western Area Power Administration-Upper Great plain, a division of the United  States Department of Energy.
Can you please change the name on the  accounts.
I thought we came to agreement that this is what we would do for  divisions, and Legal would be contacted if they wouldn't add the legal name  on to the account.
The people who approve Password Applications should be  sorting this out.
Can you please let me know how these two get resolved.
Thanks.
