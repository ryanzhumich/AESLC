Attached are the referenced lists.
If the Credit Counterparty is "amended" I  don't have any changes to what I've previously said about the counterparty  unless I add "w/change" (which I didn't have any on these lists, so just keep  the Legal approvals the same).
The only counterparty on the 12/22/99 list  was a "read only" counterparty, so I didn't bother responding to that list.
For physical power, again, even 'tho I'm not saying it, "no" for European  based physical power products.
