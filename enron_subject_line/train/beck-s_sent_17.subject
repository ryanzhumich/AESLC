I hope that you got my reminder message that I was attending Wes Colwell's  PRC meeting today, which kept me from attending the ENW staff meeting over  lunch today.
My remaining PRC obligations are as follows:   Friday, Dec. 8   Energy Operations PRC   8:00 am until ?
(ENA, EGM, EIM)   Monday, Dec. 11 `  Enron Wholesale Services PRC  8:00 - 9:30 am   Wednesday, Dec. 13  Associates       7:30 am until ?
The Enron Americas Management Team Offsite scheduled for Las Vegas December  13-16 had been cancelled, so I will be in the office all of next week.
