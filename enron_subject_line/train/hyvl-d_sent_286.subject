Gentlemen:  Here are the revised documents in both clean and marked form.
The marked  form is now in black.
I made the requested change in the Term section.
That  section defines a Early Termination as any termination prior to the end of 3  contract years.
As such no change was needed to the Buyer's Contract  section.
Please call if you need anything further.
Thanks, Dan
