I spoke to Howard Volz at CT Corporation today, and he said he sent the  renewal to DAPSA in November (their renewal date is Feb. 1 of each year) and  hasn't heard from them.
I asked him to refax the renewal notice to them.
He  said CT will not revoke the consent for about 5-6 more weeks, so we've got  some time to resolve this.
I'll keep you posted.
