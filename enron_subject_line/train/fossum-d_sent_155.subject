I got a call from Tino earlier today (right after our meeting on Pueblo) but  could only talk to him for a few minutes before I had to jump off.
I did let  him know that Kevin or Lorraine would be calling to talk about info that we  need to complete our analysis of the economics.
He also let me know that  they are looking at another power plant project in the SW Power Pool and want  to discuss with us.
Thanks.
