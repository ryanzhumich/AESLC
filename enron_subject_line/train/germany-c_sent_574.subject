I heard from Algon yesterday on those contracts I said not to pay.
We made a  mistake releasing the capacity so ENA will be responsible for the charges.
I  do not want to bill CES for these charges since we made the mistake.
This  should only be a problem for May and June, I think.
Please pay the disputed amounts.
