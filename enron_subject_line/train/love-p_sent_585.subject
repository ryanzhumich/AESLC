FYI- We need to be more careful with which of the two curves above we use for  physical deals.
We have had some substantial OA for Jan 01 production  because the basis curves for these two locations were .30 different.
Usually  these are less than .05 different.
If you have a physical mich physical it  should be Mich_cg-gd in tagg(which is michigan consolidated pipe in sitara),  if it is consumers power, it will be mich/cons and cec pipe in sitara.
Any  questions, ask.
Thanks.
