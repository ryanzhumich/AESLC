Attached is a file listing all of the curves we had that posted as 0 price  for 3/31/01.
We need these pub posted as the same price as the 30th - prices  are included in this file.
We need these pub posted ASAP so that we can  flash march detail.
Risk does not have authorization to override an existing  pub posting, this is why we need your help.
If you have any questions,  please give me a shout.
Thanks for your help.
