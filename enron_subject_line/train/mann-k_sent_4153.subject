Reagan,  I've requested the issuance of a draft master (gas) for Clarksdale.
Yazoo  has theirs in hand, but I haven't heard any of any comments.
The power side is a bit more complicated.
Yazoo City and Clarksdale have not  cut a deal between them to determine how to buy power - whether it should be  bought  by MDEA (easier in some accounting respects, but credit is more of an  issue) or by the individual Cities.
Maybe this should be on the list for our 300 meeting.
