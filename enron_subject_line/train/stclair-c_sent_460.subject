Pam: How are things with you?
I am doing great and feeling great!
I've got about  another 8 weeks to go and I'm looking forward to getting this part over  with.
I hope to work until pretty close to the end if my doctor lets me.
Are you free for lunch anytime soon?
I would love to see you and catch up.
E-mail me back with some good dates and hopefully we can get together.
Tell  Patti I said hi.
Carol
