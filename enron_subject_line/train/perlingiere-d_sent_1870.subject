Paul,  I have made revisions as discussed to the Master Agreement.
However we need  to include on "Exhibit A" info regarding "Invoices, Payments", etc.
You may  either send me this information or complete  the document at your convenience.
Please check the final revisions,  if in agreement,  print two originals  sign, and forward both to my attention.
Upon final execution, I will return  an original for your records.
It has been a pleasure working with you in finalizing this agreement.
Regards,
