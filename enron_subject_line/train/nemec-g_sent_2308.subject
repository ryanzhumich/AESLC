Clement,  Attached is the Enron Corp. guaranty for Transco's transportation  agreement.
We revised the interest language to make it clear we are not  subject to double interest and put in a limited performance guaranty for the  Company's execution of the transportation agreements.
Please  review and let me know if you have questions.
