Steve: I am faxing to you my response to your Guarnty comments.
While we are  waiting on my credit person, would it be possible to get a redraft of the  schgedules from you since a good portion of the comments that we discussed I  beleieve we agreed to and would help me focus on what is left to discuss with  my people?
We have alos modified recently our form of LC and I have enclosed  it for your review.
Thanks.
