I just wanted to let you know that I sent this letter to Dr. Harris addresses  his concerns and stating my commitment to succeeding at The Texas Graduate  School of Business.
I hope I have done what it takes to prove that I can  succeed at the School.
Thanks again for your help and interest.
Sincerely,
