I met with Karen Marshall today.
She is in the Community Relations group and  is organizing the dinner on September 7th.
I suggested that she add to the  invitation list the other interviewers this year for the scholarships (Roger  Ondreko and Gene Humphrey), Brent Price and Loftis Fitzwater (one of last  year's scholarhip recepients who started with us as an Associate this  summer).
I have also volunteered to coordinate with the University on  appropriate attendees, as some of Karen's info is dated and she does not know  people at the school.
I will keep you posted.
