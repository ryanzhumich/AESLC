Hi Greg,   We are hosting a meeting from 9-11am on Friday 26th October for a number of people from your Military.
They are coming to see us as a reference sight for TIBCO software, which they may want to use within their operations.
Given the current state of the nation I thought this might be a good opportunity for Enron to help out.
I also wanted to know if you or Mr Lay may want meet them.
Let me know, they are on a very tight schedule and are visiting NASA directly after us.
These guys are Washington based employees.. Stratcom controls our nuclear  arsenal..  Uniformed Military  Lt. Col Hal Ellis  Major Kenryu Bryson  Lt.
Commander Doug Koekkoek  Civilian Military Employees  Tom Price  Mark Roth        Mark Pickering  Chief Technology Officer  Enron Net Works, LLC
