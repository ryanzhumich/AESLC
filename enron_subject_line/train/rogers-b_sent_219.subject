Shelly: I received your e-mail regarding this years Super Saturday's.
I am currently  an Associate, but as an Analyst I participated in a couple of Super  Saturday's, but haven't done any in a little while, so I wanted to offer up  my services.
Please let me know if there is anything I can do, because I'll  be more than happy to help out again.
Thanks!
Ben
