We would like to begin trading a new product on EOL.
The location - PG&E  Topock -  has already been set up, but we would like to make a small change  to the long description.
The line which reads  -  "The transaction is for  delivery at PG&E, El Paso."
should be changed to "The transaction is for  delivery at PG&E Topock"    Please let me know when we can review the change,  as Mike Grigsby would like to begin trading this product as soon as  possible.
Thanks.
