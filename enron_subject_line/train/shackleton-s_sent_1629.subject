All:  Attached is a short recap of the items which I have been discussing  with Clint and Jeff.
I'd like to get together sometime today or tomorrow.
Rex and Jim:  I will fax to you copies of the Enron Corp. resolutions (some  final, some draft only) referenced in the attached summary.
I may not have  the latest information and perhaps you can update and address when we meet.
Please call me with a suggested time.
This afternoon is best for me.
