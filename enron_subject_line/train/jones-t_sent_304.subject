Blue Range Resources Corporation is an executed ISDA Master we have for ECT  Canada that went into bankruptcy.
It shows up on my list because I'm working  off the original list, but it is not a good Credit counterparty so it doesn't  show up on Credit's approved counterparty list.
I just want to make sure  that we don't send them any mailouts.
