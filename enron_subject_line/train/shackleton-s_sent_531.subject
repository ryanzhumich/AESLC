Sorry, but I still can't talk.
Although Marie is not in today, I can have  Susan Bailey (Ext.
34737) contact Morgan to alert them that the faxed docs  are coming.
We also will need a signature on the agreement itself and I  can't recall if Marie sent that already.
Please call Susan so that we can be  more specific about what might happen today (and whether it can wait until  Monday morning when Marie returns).
I have not received anything from  Robert.
Thanks.
Sara
