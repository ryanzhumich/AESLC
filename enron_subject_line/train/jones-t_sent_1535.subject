We have received a notice dated 7/10/00 from Merrill Lynch International Bank  that it intends to transfer their FX business to Merrill Lynch International  Bank Ltd., a United Kingdom incorporated bank regulated by the SFA,   effective as of the fourth quarter of 2000.
We do have an ISDA Master  Agreement in place with Merrill Lynch International Bank.
I am sending a copy of the notice to Gary Hickerson & Tanya Rohauer (I am  also sending Tanya the financials of the new entity).
We will await Credit's  instructions as to how they would like to proceed after reviewing the  documentation.
