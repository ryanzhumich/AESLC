Just wanted to remind everyone, party at my house on May 19th starting around  4 p.n., probably eat around 6-6:30.
I am going to write out a map shortly  and hand it out.
Please let me know if you can not attend and if you prefer  any beer preferences(will have plenty of non alcoholic and wine and booze for  PRyder).
Don't forget to bring your dates so my wife has someone to talk  to.
Let me know if dogs or cats bother you so I can put them out(especially  the damn cats).
