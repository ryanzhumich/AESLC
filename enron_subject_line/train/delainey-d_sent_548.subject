Sorry about the confusion.
Fran Mayes will be sending a memo out in the next  day or so reflecting the times of the PRC.
In order to accommodate Dave's  meeting with all you and to include Mark Frevert we had to move the time of  the PRC from 8:00 am to 11:00 am.
The ONLY thing changed was the time, the date and place remain the same.
Again, I am sorry for the confusion and I hope this helps.
If you have any  question, please feel free to call me.
Thanks,
