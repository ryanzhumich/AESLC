I just wanted to give you an update on the NDA for the referenced  counterparty.
I faxed your signed draft to Andrew Hausman this morning.
He  finally got back to me a few minutes ago to let me know that he's looking for  a lawyer on his side to review it.
He has one comments already I'll run by  Mark.
Otherwise, we're waiting for him to get back with his lawyer's  comments.
