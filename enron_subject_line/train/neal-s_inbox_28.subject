Scott, Nice chating with you yesterday.
I am in Chicago today.
It's going to be interesting if we can grow the Ag.
Group for Enron on the Grain/Oilseed side.
Think I can bring good value for them from the start, they want to go global too,  Fyi, the guys that I met where Ted Noble, Darren Maloney and also Elsa  Saludos,  Pablo  PS: Thanks for leting Elsa now my references.
