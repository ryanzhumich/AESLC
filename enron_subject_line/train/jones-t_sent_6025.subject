Be careful using IMC Canada to prepare your draft from.
Even though we have  chosen NY law, we had two Canadian companies entering into the IMC Canada  agreement so there is language in the agreement that is Canadian specific,  and it might be missing some required US language.
I have also attached a  redlined draft reflecting the negotiated changes to the form since the form  we first sent the form to the counterparty.
I have attached our current  form of ISDA Schedule as a reference.
The Canadian changes will be color  coded, so you can see them easily.
Also, please note:  there have been recent amendments to the CFTC Rules that  have required certain changes to the swap reps, in particular there are no  longer "eligible swap participants",  the current terminology is "eligible  contract participant".
Please see Part 5(b) of the Schedule in particular.
