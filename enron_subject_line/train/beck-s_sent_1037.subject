I would like to invite each of you to participate in a brainstorming session  with me on Friday, January 12 from 8:30 am through lunch.
The purpose of  this meeting will be to surface and capture ideas around the potential  commercialization of mid and back office services that we provide.
I know  that many of you have ideas about services and/or products that could be  marketed and some of you have been involved in arrangements where we have or  are currently providing services to outside parties.
While there are efforts  underway with certain modules under CommodityLogic, I want this session to be  used to take a broader look at how we might market mid and back office  services.
I hope that you will be able to attend.
Details on location of the meeting and more exact timing will be sent to you  on Monday when Patti returns from vacation.
