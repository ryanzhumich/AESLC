Tana has pointed out that Net Works does not have a policy (at least not one  we have heard of) regarding the handling of original contract documentation  after it is executed.
There is not an Enron-wide policy but instead a  patch-work of policies created by the operating units.
Tana and I would be  happy to discuss this with you - or whoever you want to designate - and make  suggestions if you don't already have a plan in mind.
