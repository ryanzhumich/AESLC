At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am attaching a clean and blacklined  draft of the Schedule and Credit Support Annex to the referenced ISDA Master  Agreement.
Can you please provide or confirm the following information:  (1)  since the Counterparty is Australian, I have added the Counterparty's ACN  Number to the document.
Can you please provide that number to us.
(2) Can  you take a look at the definition of "Obligors" in the Credit Support Annex  and let us know if it references the correct Obligors under the Loan  Agreement.
Since I will not be in the office this afternoon, can you please call Sara at  (713) 853-5620 or Stephanie Panus at (713) 345-3249 with your comments.
Thanks for your attention herewith.
