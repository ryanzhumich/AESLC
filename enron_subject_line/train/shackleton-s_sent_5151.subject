Holli:  I have still not received the above-mentioned comments.
I have also not  received EWEB's proposed form of legal opinion.
I will go ahead and  blackline the Schedule once again.
When the lawyers last spoke, we agreed to execute all docs prior to the end  of the year.
Would you please call EWEB and inquire about these items?
Thanks.
Sara
