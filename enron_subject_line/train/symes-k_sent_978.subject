The attached document contains the EPMI average prices for all delivery  points for Sun., March 25, and Mon., March 26.
Please let me know if you have  any problems opening the document or reading it.
The worksheet should look  identical to the fax I send each day.
An additional worksheet shows a detail  of each deal volume and price.
I'm in the habit of excluding the counterparty  names (to save time) because I'm the only one who looks at this sheet  normally; but if you'd like me to start e-mailing instead of faxing the  prices I will begin entering the counterparty names as well.
Thanks,
