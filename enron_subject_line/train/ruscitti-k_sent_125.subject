BL,  Have you experienced any blackouts yet?
I think you'll see a lot this summer.
What does everyone think about the situation?
Do they think it's a threat or  not?
I think the state is in for a horrific summer - I hope it doesn't turn out that way,  but it'll be incredibly difficult to avoid.
Hope everything's going well with work and with the family.
When's the next  time you'll be in Dallas?
Let me know.
KR
