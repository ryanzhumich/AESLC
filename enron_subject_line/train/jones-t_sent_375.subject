I just got an update from the OMLX of their rules.
Do you need me to make  you a copy or are you also getting updates?
Also, I get faxes of all their  notices.
So far nothing I've received has been interesting.
Do you get  copies of their notices?
Do you need me to send you anything I feel is worth  noting?
They've also promoted me to Compliance Director, so I'm going to go in and  ask Mark for a raise to match my title!
