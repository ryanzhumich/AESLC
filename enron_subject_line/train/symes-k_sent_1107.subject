Because I'm not quite sure who to direct this request to, I'm e-mailing  everyone I think might be involved in entering new counterparty names.
One of  our mid-marketers has executed a deal with Sierra Pacific Holding Company,  which is a new counterparty name and needs to be added as a choice in  Enpower.
Please let me know if I've contacted the correct people, and if I've  contacted the incorrect people.
(Sorry!)
Thanks,
