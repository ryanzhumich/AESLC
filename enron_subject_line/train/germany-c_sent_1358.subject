I knew we would have to address this eventually.
CES is long 3600/month in TGT Z4 at CG&E.
I showed them a $2.66 bid for  tomorrow.
Before I had worked up the price, CES decided to take the gas into  CGAS at Lebanon.
This gets real messy.
Is there any way we can refuse this?
At first, I was  thinking we would have to do this.
Now, I don't like the idea because it  will be really messy in the summer.
