TP2 is buying Spinnaker gas (deal 632998) from Gulf 1 at Zone 2 IF (deal  657407).
TP2 is selling the gas back to Gulf1 at IF plus variable cost (deal  657409) at St 45.
It is my understanding that the transport commodity rate  for gas from this well is $.02 plus fuel.
SO, I just changed the price on  deal 657409 from Z2 IF + .09 to Z2 IF + .045.
We should see about $68,000.00  move from TP2 to Gulf 1.
