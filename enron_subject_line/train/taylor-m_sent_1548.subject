In case you haven't already looked at the Fee Agreement draft, here is a  slightly revised version.
Also attached is a revised BETA.
The changes  marked in the BETA are a combination of the commercial guy's comments and my  revisions of those comments (hopefully marked separately).
Unfortunately I  didn't get the changes in the Fee Agreement marked.
