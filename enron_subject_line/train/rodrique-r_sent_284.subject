Hey,  What's going on?
I've had a fabulous day...at least it hasn't been boring.
Anything interesting in your world?
It's the first night and I already want to skip my GMAT class.
I may come  visit you before I go to my class.
I don't want to hang around down here  until 6.
That is if you aren't too busy today.
Talk to ya later, Robin
