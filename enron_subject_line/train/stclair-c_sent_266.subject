Elizabeth and Leslie: I received a call from UtiliCorp's counsel yesterday and he was asking  questions about how we would structure an option with respect to power.
He  was describing an financial  option that could be settled physically and was  wondering who the counterparty on our side would be.
Would or can we do such  an option and if so, would ENA or EPMI be the counterparty?
