Per my conversation with Credit, it appears there are two Northern States  Power Companies.
We have already reviewed Northern States Power Company, a  Minnesota corporation (cpy ID #265).
The counterparty that showed up on  yesterday's list is Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation  (cpy ID #161).
The Wisconsin corporation is a sub of the Minnesota  corporation.
I don't know if this makes any difference in your approvals...
