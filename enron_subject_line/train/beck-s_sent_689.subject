As a follow up to our discussion earlier this week on commercialization of  mid and back office services and managing those responsibilities for EWS, I  will have a timeline for your review on Monday that will pinpoint key dates:   Unify conversion, EES absorption, HPL sale, commercialization, Todd Busby's  arrival, etc.
I will also have details of resource needs.
We can use this  to set internal expectations on the timing of successfully handling all of  these initiatives.
I will welcome your comments on the timeline.
