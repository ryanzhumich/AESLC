Hi Carol,  I saw that you posted about getting a nanny.
I've used two services, but  only one that I can suggest.
For my last nanny, I used Morningside Nanny  Service, or something close to that.
They seemed thorough, and found us a  wonderful person.
I've also used River Oaks Nanny, but they sent me a nut  case.
Good luck,  Kay
