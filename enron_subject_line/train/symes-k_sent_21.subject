As you may have gathered by now, the West Origination Group has purchased  season tickets to see the Portland Trail Blazers on their path to  championship glory.
We have four seats which will be used primarily to  entertain customers and foster outside business relationships.
Please look over the attached schedule and determine the game dates you would  like to reserve.
Tickets will be distributed on a first-come first-serve  basis, so be sure to plan as far in advance as possible.
Games that have not  been reserved as of three days prior will be distributed internally or given  to outside parties.
If you have any questions or would like to reserve tickets, please contact  Blazer Command Central by e-mail, telephone, or in person.
Include the date  of the games you would like to go to and the name of the customers you will  be taking.
