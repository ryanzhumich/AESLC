David: Grant has faxed to me Crestar's comments to the PA and ETA.
As I explained  to Grant, some of them are legal and some of them, I think, will require  input from you and perhaps can be resolved in a call to them.
I am going to  have this delivered to you with my thoughts on some of the comments assuming  that we couldn't talk them into accepting these docs as is.
Please let me  know when convenient how best to proceed.
