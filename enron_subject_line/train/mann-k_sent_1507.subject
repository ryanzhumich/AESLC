I suggest we give GE a time line for completing each of the break out  contracts.
I'm unfamiliar with the individual project requirements, so I'm  asking  your help.
I believe City of Austin is ready to go as soon as the  form is complete, and it could be a great candidate for working on  immediately.
I know the ESA project has some time sensitivity as well.
Please let me know what you think.
