Rich, would you please add Tim Aron to your distribution list for the Gallup  Weekly Updates, and also forward him your latest?
He is working on New  Mexico regulatory and legislative issues pertaining to our compression  contract, and I thought your updates would help keep him in the loop.
Thank  you.
