Celeste,  I am forwarding you a letter from Prof. Duane Seppi from Carnegie Mellon  University.
I have known Duane for many years and I know that he does not make his recommendations without very good reasons.
I would recommend looking at John Gordon as a very strong candidate: I think he will make a terrific contribution to Enron.
