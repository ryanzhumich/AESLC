Bill:  I couldn't recall if I mentioned the above entity (35% Enron owned and  65% Burlington owned, I understand) but I was contacted by Ranabir Dutt  (X35274) to review an ISDA and 10 year rate swap for Lost Creek and Barclays  Bank PLC..
I told Ranabir to contact credit.
He said that was Enron was  immediately selling its interest.
The swap becomes effective 9/15/00.
