Barry - For your cost center, I increased travel by $25k and Conferences & Training by $2,697.
I didn't make any other changes to Mark's.
These two files show the detail.
This file shows the combined plan for West Origination.
The "Income Statement" tab is what will be presented to Office of the Chair.
Let me know if you need anything else.
Thanks,
