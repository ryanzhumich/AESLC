Hello!
Here is the latest draft on Garden State/Project Barbed Wire.
As I mentioned  to Dee, the agreement is due to be signed on Tuesday, 7/11.
Dee/Rick, I just learned that there are multi-employer plans for the  unionized employees.
I'll provide details as I learn them.
I guess you can forward your comments to me, with a copy to Stuart Zisman.
Thanks.
Michelle
