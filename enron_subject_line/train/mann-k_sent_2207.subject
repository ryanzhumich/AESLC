Hi there,  Thanks for taking my car in.
I admit I feel like men get treated better by  car servicing people than women.
I'm not just saying that, either.
On the issue of Charlotte, is it your idea that she will take care of  Tuesdays only while you are going to rodeo meetings?
I know in her email she  had a preference for not doing the Sharon thing, and I do think we lost  something when we (well, you) weren't communicating with Sharon or Amy in a  regular basis.
I know it is easy for me to say since it is an inconvenience  for you...  ckm
