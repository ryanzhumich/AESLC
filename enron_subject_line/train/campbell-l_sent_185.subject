Dan, sorry about taking so long it getting back to you about this, but I had  a couple of crises I had to address,  Im still realing from the impact.
I  have attached for your review the agreement which we are in the process of  finalizing with the Wild Turkey Federation.
Take a look at the document and  let me know what you think.
After your review we can make the necessary  changes and modifications.
I have been advised by our legal department that  each of the three major pipelines owned and operated by Enron will need a  separate contract, with the RMEF, so what we decide for Transwestern, will  undoubtably work for the others.
Thanks for your patience in this.
