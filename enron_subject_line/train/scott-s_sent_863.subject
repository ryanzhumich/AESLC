Via a quick phone call to Little Woodrow's I was informed that the "steak  dude" (as nstepha has coined him) cooks come rain, sleet, snow or shine.
Thus, our evening out is on.
See everyone there around 7:30 p.m.
If you  can't make it till later that's OK we'll save you a seat.
Besides, most of  you would probably put good money down on my being there until closing.
Cheers.
