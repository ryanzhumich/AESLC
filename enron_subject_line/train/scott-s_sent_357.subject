Attached pursuant to TK Lohman's request is an electronic copy of  Transwestern's October 17, 2000 FERC filing proposing a transport options  program.
This copy does not include the tariff sheets as they are not available in  electronic format.
If you would like to see the proposed tariff sheets,  please let me know and I will be happy to fax them to you.
If you have questions or comments about transport options, please contact  either TK or me.
