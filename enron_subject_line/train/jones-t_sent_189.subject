I'm working with Mike Corbally's office to get the missing information on  Reporting Service, Reporting Agency and Datasource for the European based  weather confirmations.
As soon as I have that information available, I will  plug it into the confirms and email the confirms to you.
Mark Taylor said someone there in London Legal was working on a list of  approved jurisdictions for derivatives.
Is it ready yet?
Can I get a copy  of it?
I need it to continue my work on the approved counterparty list.
Thanks!
