I'm attaching a revised draft of the option to purchase the land for the  VEPCO deal.
I've limited it to the land in Edgecombe County, changed the  initial period to 90 days (with 3 x 90 day renewals).
The price is changed  to $137,600, as have the option payments ($3500 for each 90 day period).
Is  there anything else which needs to be changed?
FYI, I've left a message for Dutch Bumgarnder, VEPCO's lawyer, concerning the  interconnection agreement, and who is doing what.
Thanks,
