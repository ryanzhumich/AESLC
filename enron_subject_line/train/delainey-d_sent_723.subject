Richard, it is my understanding that this investment is currently in Ray  Bowen's business.
In my ENA shoes, I would say we would have no interest in  taking on that responsibility.
In my EES shoes, I would like to take a  closer look at the possible connections.
Please send me some info on the  investment fund and their current investments portfolio.
I have also heard that Tom White has been talking to you about EES taking on  the Catalytica investment.
With my EES shoes on, no way!!!!
Regards
