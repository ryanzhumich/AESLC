Anne,  After NX1 going forward, I would like to load my final positions in the  LIQBasis tab in NCD.
The positions will include basis, physindex and gd  index positions.
We can then run settlement index scenarios to see what my  risk will be to index postings.
This will be a huge benefit.
Gracias, Mike
