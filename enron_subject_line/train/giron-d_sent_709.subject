I have a friend who is looking to change employers.
He is in the IT field.
I was looking on the intranet and found this posting.
Although, he would be  interested in any similar job.
I will attach his resume.
What is the best  way to get his resume in front of the proper people?
I would appreciate your  opinion.
I don't work in the IT field and really don't know anyone at Enron  that does.
Thanks in advance for your help.
