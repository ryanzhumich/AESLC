JDavies@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Dear NYISO Customer:  The version mapping that was posted to the web on 06/08/2001 was created from a customer file that joined the NYISO on April 11, 2000.
This resulted in the mapping not being valid for any customers that were already qualified for the entire month of April.
For all customers that were qualified customers for the entire month of April 2000, the following mapping applies:  Date Current             Previous 1    V-7       minus          V-4 2    V-7       minus          V-4 3    V-7       minus          V-4 4    V-7       minus          V-4 5    V-6       minus          V-4 6    V-6       minus          V-4 7    V-6       minus          V-4 8    V-6       minus          V-4 9    V-7       minus          V-4 10   V-7       minus          V-4 11   V-7       minus          V-4 12   V-7       minus          V-4 13   V-7       minus          V-4 14   V-7       minus          V-4 15   V-6       minus          V-4 16   V-6       minus          V-4 17   V-7       minus          V-4 18   V-7       minus          V-4 19   V-7       minus          V-4 20   V-7       minus          V-4 21   V-7       minus          V-4 22   V-7       minus          V-4 23   V-6       minus          V-4 24   V-6       minus          V-4 25   V-7       minus          V-4 26   V-7       minus          V-4 27   V-7       minus          V-4 28   V-7       minus          V-4 29   V-7       minus          V-4 30   V-6       minus          V-4   Regards,
