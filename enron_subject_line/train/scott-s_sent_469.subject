Dan,  I am currently sitting in the Coal group's old area on 32.
While dealing  with some computer issues Friday, I came across an expandable file full of  Coal related documents buried beneath my desk.
The documents and contracts  seem pretty old, which is why I assume no one has missed them.
Still, I  wanted to contact you to see if you would like me to run them down rather  than simply discard them.
If you could email or call me at x31455 and let me  know what I should do with them I would appreciate it (as you know space is  limited up here).
Thanks,
