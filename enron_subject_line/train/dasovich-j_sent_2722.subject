Mark: Here's the info  Size = 500 MW Purchase price = $42 MM (sold to Calpine) Permit  status at time of sale = all permits had been obtained  One note:  while we had gas and electric interconnection agreements ready to  execute, Calpine told us not to and they arranged those for themselves.
If there's anything else that you need don't hesitate.
Happy holidays.
Best,
