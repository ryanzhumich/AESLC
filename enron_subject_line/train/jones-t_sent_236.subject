I also noticed the ISDA memo, and was rooting around looking for the  attachments that went with it, and couldn't find them.
There was also a few  updates in a second memo there to some country opinions.
If and when Mark  calls in I was going to ask him if he knows where the attachments went,  because the one will cost $100 if we have to order it.
