Barring weather issues, it would appear as though we are on for Little  Woodrow's tonight.
I don't believe a definite time has been set as of yet,  but seeing as how they ran out of steaks last week I suggest we get there as  early as possible.
Should we be rained out an alternative location will be chosen.

Beef...It's what's for dinner.
