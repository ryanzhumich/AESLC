Sheila:  Paul Radous (Ext.
58356) in credit will be monitoring brokerage  accounts from a credit perspective.
I have provided him with an overview of  the "process".
When he has had an opportunity to digest the information, I  think it would be helpful to meet with Paul.
In the meantime, would you  please begin to copy Paul on all messages to Ted Murphy regarding the purpose  of new accounts.
Thanks.
Sara
