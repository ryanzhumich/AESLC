Gentlemen,  Things are heating up, no pun intended.
Therefore, it would be helpful if you  would prepare a closing list for the GE turbines moving out of WestLB.
I  know it is short, but I thrive on lists.
I cannot tell you how many calls I've swapped with ABB's rep about that  contract, without ever hooking up.
I see that we will be facing a fire drill  quickly in getting at least some of these transformers into the right  financing vehicle.
Therefore, please prepare a list of site specific issues  for that document as well.
Thanks,
