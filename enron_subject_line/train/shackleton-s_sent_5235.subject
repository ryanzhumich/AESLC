Phil:  Happy New Year!
And back to old business.
ENA is holding the amendment pending receipt from  you of the attached Exhibit A (describing the collateral).
I had previously  left you a message but I'm sure it was lost in the year-end madness.
Please  forward the attachment so that we have a complete document.
Thanks.
Sara
