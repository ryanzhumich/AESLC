Our contract with IGS provides that for any agreement identified by IGS and  executed, TW will pay a one-time incentive fee of 3% of the first $15 million  of net present value, 2% of the next $10 million of net present value, etc.
The Southern contract associated with the Gallup Expansion is at a rate of  $0.205 for 25,000 Dth/d for 5 years.
Using a discount factor of 15%, the net  present value of the contract is $6,270,625, so IGS's commission would be  $188,118.75.
Since the contract does not specify how NPV will be calculated  (I believe we purposely omitted this for whatever reason), we will need to  agree on a rate that is fair given the nature of and risk associated with the  project.
We should probably use whatever is standard in the industry for  this type of project, if that's possible to determine.
I have a call in to  James Centilli for his recommendation in this regard, and will let you know  what he says.
