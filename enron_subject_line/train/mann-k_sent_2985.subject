I made a couple of minor revisions.
Jake has given us until when he gets in  tomorrow.
I changed Turbine Agreement to Turbine Contract (one place in the LOI), and  added responsibility for filing fees in the llc agreement.
Perhaps it it  redundant.
I'm not sure I'm on top of the LLC agreement.
Maybe we can discuss in the  am.
