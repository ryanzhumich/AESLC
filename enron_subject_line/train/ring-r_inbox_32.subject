Upon becoming a NEPOOL member, EESI chose to satisfy the Financial Assurance Policy requirement by  issuance of Performance Bond(s) via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, which issued a Performance Bond  in the amount of $8,000,000.
On or about October 12, 2001, EESI received a letter from ISO New England dated October 10, 2001, indicating  that EESI's current Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase the amount to  $11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.
In telephone conversations with ISO-NE, EESI was informed that in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default  the matter needed to be resolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (October 19, 2001).
By October 16, EESI had requested a bond increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000,  but encountered delays in working with the bond company.
EESI Credit Department personnel sent ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001, via FAX, a copy of the request  to the bond company for revisions to the Performance Bond, and indicated EESI was working diligently to resolve  the matter.
Following resolution of delays with the bond company, a bond increase was issued by the bond company on  October 23, 2001, executed by EESI on October 23, 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO-NE  on October 23, 2001.
EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to resolve the Financial Assurance Default due  to delays with the bond company as mentioned above.
