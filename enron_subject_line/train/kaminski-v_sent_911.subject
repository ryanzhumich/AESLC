Norma,  I am sending you an Excel spreadsheet with proposed merit and equity increases.
I have slightly exceeded the merit quota.
The equity increases address two issues: retention and and an error in setting a salary at hiring (I tend to be too stingy).
Please, let me know if there are any questions.
I am forwarding a copy of the spreadsheet to my home address so I can work on it tonight, if necessary.
Vince
