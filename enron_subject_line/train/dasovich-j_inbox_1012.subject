Jeanne, with Heather's assistance, please contact Jeff D. ASAP and get  the details so that Enron (I believe the EES and EEMC entities are at issue, but I do not know for sure which one) need to file their $1000 fee and their registration update forms, as they are tardy.
They  will also owe SEction 394.25 standard service plan forms and must update their deposit bond by Jan. 2, 2002.
Please help get this taken care of ASAP, Jeff considers it a priority--and needless to say does not trust me to do it correctly.
Thanks,
