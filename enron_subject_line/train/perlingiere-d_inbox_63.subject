MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT:  ANNUAL MEETING AND ELECTION OF 2002 WENH BOARD  Dear Members:  The  annual meeting of the Women's Energy Network of Houston is normally held at the November or December luncheon meeting.
This year, however, WENH  held two out-of-the-ordinary events in November and December that precluded the annual meeting from being held in those months.
WENH's bylaws provide that "if the December meeting is not held, the annual meeting shall be held at the next WENH meeting."
Accordingly, the WENH Board of Directors has scheduled the annual meeting to be held at our January luncheon meeting at Brennan's Restaurant, 3300 Smith St., on January 9, 2002, at 12:00 p.m.  At the annual meeting, the WENH membership in attendance will elect the Officers and Directors of the WENH Board of Directors for 2002.
No WENH member may vote by proxy.
Following careful deliberation of all nominated candidates, the Nominating Committee, composed of Leesa Foster, President; Robin Dyer, Immediate Past President; Lisa Craig, Vice President and retiring Board member; Meg Healy, WENH member; and Karyl Lawson, WEHN member (with Denise Cassata, WENH member, as a substitute at the Nominating Committee's final meeting) hereby announces its recommended slate for the upcoming elections at the annual meeting, as follows:  2002 WENH Board Nominations   POSITION			NOMINATION  President 			Tammy Naron				  Vice President			Tammy Dowe  Secretary	  		Mary Wilson  Treasurer			Tammy Norman    Assistant Treasurer		Suzy Romoser  Program Director		Mary Ann Reynolds  Career Director			Cynthia Thomson 		  Public Relations Director	Robin Dyer			  Communications Director	Nancy Fitzgerald  Industry Relations Director	Nancy Sauer 	  Special Events Director	               Carol McCutcheon   Directors-at-Large	               Melinda Pharms 	                                               Kay Henry  We look forward to seeing you at the annual meeting at our January luncheon.
