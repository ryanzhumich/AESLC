Here are the home games when Meagan will be dancing in the half-time routine:   Friday, September 15  7:00 pm   Saturday, October 14  7:00 pm   Friday, October 20  7:00 pm  (homecoming)   There is a chance that she could be added to two other home games if  alternates are needed.
Nothing definitive on that, of course.
She did get  put into a routine last year as an alternate, but you never know.
We would love for you to come for a visit this fall, and it would be fun if  it would work around one of these games.
I have also given this schedule to  Cindy, as she and Brigeda were interested in making it to a game.
I am headed to Dallas early tomorrow morning.
Patti has sent you a copy of  my itinerary.
