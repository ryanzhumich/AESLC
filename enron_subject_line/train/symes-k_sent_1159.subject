Looks like we might have to modify this name in EnPower after all - The dba  on our master agreement is "Sierra Pacific Industries" with no "Inc." at the  end.
I just spoke with Bob Ellery over at Sierra, and he confirmed that,  although the company is a corporation, they never use "Inc." in their  contracts.
Thus, our confirm letters would not match up with the master  agreement because of those three pesky letters.
Just let me know if this causes a problem for either of you.
In case you'd  like to reference it, the deal number we're attempting to modify is 573679 -  it's a buy from Sierra done by Chris Foster on the 10th of April.
