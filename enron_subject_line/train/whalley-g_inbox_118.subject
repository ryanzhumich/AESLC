Greg,  I've been helping the HR team draft this memo.
Cindy asked that I run it by you prior to having it sent out.
Any comments?
As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining our diverse and talented workforce.
We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class - the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.
We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.
