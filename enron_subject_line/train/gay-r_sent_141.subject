I will be out on Th & FRi because my wife is having surgery.
I can't have my  cel on in the hospital but I will have it with me and will check voice mail  from time to time.
Shelly Butler with the Associate program HR indicated that by giving Tracee  the short term employment we will be responsible for her termination package  at the end of that time (approx.
6 mos or $40,000).
We probably need to do  some structuring here, no?
