ADesell@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  As directed by FERC in its September 4, 2001 Order in docket ER01-2536-000, the NYISO has completed the calculation of the revenue neutral translation into Unforced Capacity terms of the In-City $105 cap applicable to Generators subject to market power mitigation measures.
In the September 4, 2001 Order, the Commission decided that the "translated in-city price cap is to be fixed at an amount determined on the day of the first in-city capacity auction under UCAP methodology" using data from the most recent 12-month period.
On the basis of Operating Data received by the NYISO, the Capacity-weighted EFORd for all Generators subject to market power mitigation measures for the 2001-2002 Winter Capability Period Auction is 7.04%.
Thus, the In-City cap under the UCAP market design, including the Capability Period Auction scheduled for October 1, 2001, is $112.95.
