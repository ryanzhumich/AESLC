I've changed all the deals I could find that contained the counterparty name  "California Department of Water Resources - CDWR" to "California Energy  Resource Schedulers - State of California."
The following deal numbers are  those that have been changed.
If you come across other daily deals, most  likely done by EPMI Short Term California or Short Term Northwest, let me  know and I'll change those counterparty names too.
510867/860/857/853/775/774  509540/518/513/511/509/508/504/463/462  Thanks for your help on this.
