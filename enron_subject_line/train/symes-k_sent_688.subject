Just something to keep in mind -  The confirms group in Houston is waiting on signed confirm letters from Grant  County for the following three deals -  432854 420554 420563  I've let Stephanie Piwetz and Sharen Cason know that you'll forward the  letters on to them once you receive them.
Or you can give them to me and I'll  fax them over.
Keep me posted on the progress.
Thanks,
