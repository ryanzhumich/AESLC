Mike,  Checking on the status of getting Stephanie Panus, a new paralegal in our  Group, full edit access to the referenced database.
Also, we need to get some additional people full edit access:  Matt Dawson,  who just started in London Legal, and David Minns, a lawyer in our Australia  office.
Can you let me and each of these people know when they have access.
Thanks!
