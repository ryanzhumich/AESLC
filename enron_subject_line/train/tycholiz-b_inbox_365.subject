FYI.
The California AG has announced that he is investigating conflict of interest charges against consultants who were involved with arranging DWR's long term power contracts.
May be part of Davis' attempt to "re-negotiate" the contracts.
There's been some assertions that, under California law, any contracts negotiated by consultants with financial conflict of interests must be nullified.
