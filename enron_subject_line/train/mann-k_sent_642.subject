We had a wonderful, quiet weekend.
The wine was very good.
I drank it  without food, as it was nice and light, which is how I like my reds.
It  would have been good with a tomato based pasta, I think.
How do I find out how much vacation I have?
I know there's a system on the  intranet.
I want to plan some time off this year, if possible.
I know how  difficult it can get the longer I wait.
Thursday I won't be in until around noon.
More Michael stuff.
