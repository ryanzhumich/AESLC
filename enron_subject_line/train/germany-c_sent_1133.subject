Joanie's email to me about the Roanoke  pricing has me curious.
Do I need to  check the pricing on all the wholesale CES deals?
I do have some reports which Paul Drexelius gave me in January out of CES's  GMS system.
Dick had asked me to sit with Paul one afternoon and talk about  the deals.
I have not done any price verification or auditing of the deals  in Sitara.
Let me know if you want me to audit Sitara.
