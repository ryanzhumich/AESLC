We will need to catch a cab to get to La Fogata which is located at 2427  Vance Jackson Road in San Antonio.
Our dinner reservations are for 7:00 pm,  so I suggest we all meet in the hotel lobby at 6:30 and catch group cabs  together.
Dress is casual.
The phone number for the restaurant is  210-340-1337, in case you get lost in a wild cab ride or something similar  (this will have special meaning to certain swap group members!).
If you  haven't RSVP'd back to me, please do so, so I can get an accurate head count  for tomorrow.
See you in San Antonio.
