I would like to request information and application materials for your  advanced studies program in Bologna, Italy, as well as for Master's Degree  study in international relations at Johns Hopkins University.
I am interested  in applying for the academic year of 2002-2003, but I'd like to gather all  the necessary information as soon as possible.
Thank you,
