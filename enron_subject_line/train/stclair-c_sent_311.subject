Jason: Could you help me review this?
I thought that given your review of some of  the other agreements that you might have some helpful suggestions about what  to look out for from our standpoint.
I have sent a copy of this to Mark  Holsworth.
Thanks.
If we need to sit down with Mark Tawney and ask him  questions about what this should cover, let me know.
