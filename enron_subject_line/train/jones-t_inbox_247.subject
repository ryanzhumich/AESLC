I am still working on this audit and I have found in Legal's Financial Lotus Notes tracking system that Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc., created by Lisa Wheeler on 2/23/97, the status says "Draft Sent".
It should be changed to "Executed" since there is an executed copy of their Master Energy Price Swap Agreement in Livelink.
This particular Morgan Stanley's Contract number is 95000191, CP #9409.
Let me know if you have any questions.
