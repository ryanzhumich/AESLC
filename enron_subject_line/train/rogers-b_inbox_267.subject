Hello it's me again- Why don't you write back I know, I know, you are busy.
Listen, wishful thinking, I looked up flights for February (hoping you will want to go Feb 6th-Feb 10th) That is a Wed. through Sunday with 3 full days of skiing.
Anyway, there is a promotional flight to Vail for $631.22 fo both of us roundtrip Think about it!!!
