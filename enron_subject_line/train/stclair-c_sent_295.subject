Jeff: Alicia and I will get back to you with a mark-up with our thoughts on this  since some of the langugae appears to be different from what is in the  Revolver.
Alicia thought that maybe this langugae came from Condor.
My  objective here is to make sure that there is some good precedent for this  language and that this deal does not create a new standard.
