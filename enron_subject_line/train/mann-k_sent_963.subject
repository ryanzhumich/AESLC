Roxanne,  Thank you for calling last night.
We took Michael out for dinner to celebrate  his first day at SF, and missed your call.
Michael had a great first day.
All the kids drew portraits of him, and he got a big kick out of it.
I noticed on the class list that you live in Spring Valley.
We live on  Inverness Park Way, and used to live on Cedarspur a few years back.
It is  nice to know that Michael has a classmate in the neighborhood.
Again, thanks for calling.
