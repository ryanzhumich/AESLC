Alicia The only comment that I have to the swap schedules is that I think we need to  have an exception built into the arbitration language that permits us to go  to court to enforce the remedies that we describe in the confidentiality  section.
This probably hold true for all of the docs where we have  arbitration and a ca provision.
Alos, there may be some defined terms that  are now used in the new confidentiality language that haven't been defined  (i.e, Enron, Enron Put Agreement etc)  Finally, should we upper case  "affiliates" in the confidentiality   language and either use the ISDA def or  some other def?
