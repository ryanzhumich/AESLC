FYI,  I have a database where I keep track of my online approvals/declines and  reasons why (if there are any!).
I don't know to what extent Frank ever  looked at it, but you might find it helpful.
It is called "ENA Legal Online  Trading Agreements" database.
If you're interested, I'll ask Mike Neves to  get you access.
