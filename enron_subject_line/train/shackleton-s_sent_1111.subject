Hi, Serge.
I am just checking to see when Enron North America Corp. ("ENA")  will receive your comments to the ISDA Master Agreement for FP&L.
Paul Karns  mentioned that you would be devoting some time for review of the agreement.
Please let me know if I can be of any assistance.
You can reach me via email  or phone (713) 853-5620 if you have any questions.
I will be negotiating the  agreement on behalf of ENA.
