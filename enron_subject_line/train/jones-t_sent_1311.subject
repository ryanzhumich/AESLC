I just got off the phone with someone at PP&L and I am trying to coordinate  our response to assigning our physical gas, physical power, financial and  online transactions.
Per my discussion with PP&L, Shari is working on the  physical power assignments, Stacy has received the gas assignments, which in  it includes an assignment of the online account, and the woman at PP&L is  faxing me an assignment of their financial positions with us.
PP&L tells me  that we have recevied Credit approval of these assignments, although I have  not received such approval.
With respect to assigning their online account, I don't know if Frank has any  particular issues, my only issue is that we don't only assign an account, in  doing so we assign all trades under that account, and if the only trades done  with PP&L are physical gas, power & financial, then we should be alright (if  Frank is ok, in consenting to the assignment of the online account).
It  seems to be a problem with her in opening a new account.
Saying, all that, I guess I need to know if (1) Credit has approved all these  consents, (2) when power & gas have consented, and (3) if Frank is OK with  assigning the online account over...
