On the 10/05/00 List:  Tembec, Inc.'s bylaws require that agreements signed  by the company must be signed by any two of the following officers:   the  President or a Vice President together with any Director, Secretary or  Assistant Secretary.
If you are going to trade with them online you must  ensure that the Password Application gets signed by those officers, or if not  by those officers, they must provide a resolution if any officer except those  above signs the documentation.
Because of this signatory restriction  EnronOnline was hesitant to open them for financial trading.
It's up to your  group, but you must comply with these special signatory requirements.
If you  would like Legal to pass on the documentation if you are unsure, forward it  up to me.
