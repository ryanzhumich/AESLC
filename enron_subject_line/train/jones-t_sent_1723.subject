Per our conversation, I am attaching a proposed form of Unanimous Consent of  the Board of Directors of Brant-Allen Industries, Inc. ("Company") that would  expand the Consent of Directors given to us when we executed the ISDA Master  Agreement in 1998 to do more than just the single trade referenced in that  resolution.
If the enclosed meets with your approval, please have it  executed by the directors of the Company and return a copy to me for our  files.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713)  853-3399.
In addition, can you confirm one thing for me.
There is a note in our file  that says documents for the Company require two signatures.
I looked at the  Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws you provided us and find no such  signatory requirement.
Is this note an error?
