Just wanted to let you know I faxed the OMnet Agreement over to Susan Gill  today about 3:30 pm our time.
I have the originals and asked her to tell me  what address she wants me to send the originals to.
I didn't date the front  page of the agreement because I didn't know what date you wanted them to be  effective so I'll leave that to y'all to work out.
I'm working on getting  the other documents signed and I guess I can get them all out in the same  package, maybe tomorrow.
I'll visit with you tomorrow about what to do.
