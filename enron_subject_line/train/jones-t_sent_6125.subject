With respect to this new counterparty for EnronOnline (correct name to  follow):  Sam Schott advises us that we are limited to 90 characters for a counterparty  name in GCP.
The correct legal name for this counterparty is longer than 90  characters.
I discussed this with Marcus Nettelton, our power lawyer, and if  the following scenario meets with the approval of the financial and physical  power Confirmation Desks we think the best way to treat this matter is to set  the counterparty up in GCP as follows and then add this counterparty to the  special handling list so all confirmations, physical and financial, offline  and online, go out with the LEGAL NAME, not with the GCP NAME.
LEGAL NAME OF COUNTERPARTY:  Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as  authorized agent for and on behalf of IES Utilities Inc., Interstate Power  Company, and Wisconsin Power and Light Company  SUGGESTED NAME FOR GCP:   Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as Agent  for three listed utilities  Joe and Kim, is this workable for the Confirm Desks?
If you can let me and  Sam know then Sam can get them set us.
Thanks for your help!
