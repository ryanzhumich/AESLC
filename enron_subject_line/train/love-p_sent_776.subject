FYI, Sally is getting an ear full today from the RAC group about  unofficialized post id's.
We run a macro every night to verify these are  officialized.
I just want to remind everyone that this is very important  that we do this.
Our group and Jeff will catch tremendous heat if these  errors continue.
Again, this is just a reminder, we are doing a good job on  this currently.
Thanks.
