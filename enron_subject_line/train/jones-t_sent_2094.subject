Just a reminder that we have the Customer Access Agreement that Craig Breslau  sent up for our review.
We need to (1) determine what procedures, if any, we  need to put in place with respect to user ID's to other online trading  websites, and (2) respond to Craig about this agreement.
When you both get  back in town can we set a time to discuss this.
Thanks...
