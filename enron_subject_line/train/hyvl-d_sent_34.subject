Chris,  The above document is the November 17, 1999 document which has been changed  to a 3 month deal with the price change you specified.
I have received the  copy of the type of contract that they would like us to use.
I note that we  will have to make a lot of changes which is probably not warranted for a 3  month deal.
If you want us to consider using their form for a long term  deal, I will start making the necessary changes and send you back a red-lined  single transaction contract.
Will the long term deal have the same terms as  our last long term deal except for price?
