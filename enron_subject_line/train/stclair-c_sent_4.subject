Marie: I would like to fax and mail out the Annex A letters to the new  counterparties to make sure that they all get them.
My secretary is  available to help with the mail out which I would hope could be sent out no  later than the end of the day Thursday given that we are going to be away.
I  will let her know that you may be asking her to help.
I would alos want  someone while we are gone to check all of the return faxes against our list  so that they all go out to the right numbers.
Stop by if any of this is not  do-able   Tahnks.
Carol
