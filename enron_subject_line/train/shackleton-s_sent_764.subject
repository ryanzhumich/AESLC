I did speak with Ana Soria.
Her only concern was the legal opinion.
I faxed  her the format for the legal opinion and attached a cover sheet which  indicated that ENA must receive the executed opinion by the close of business  on December 29.
I've attached a copy of the fax cover sheet.
Also, Joe  Hunter has added the "Automatic Termination" provision into the  confirmation.
Have a happy holiday.
Sara
