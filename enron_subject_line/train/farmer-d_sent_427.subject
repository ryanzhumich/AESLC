As discussed in our 3-Rivers/King Ranch meeting, I have set up purchases from  the liquids group and the other 3rd parties at HGPL mtr 0012.
Due to  bridgebacks, I had to create new deal numbers for the days prior to 2/16/99.
(I went back to Dec 1999, in case it is needed.)
Please see the deal #s  below.
Teco  113858 &169759 HPLR Liquids  114099 & 169765   (existing deal to cover excess residue) Swift  93779 & 169761 ERAC  138094 & 169760 Tejones 133173 & 169762   Mandy - I understand that you will be setting up the buy and sale with HPLR  Liquids to cover the transport on HGPL.
Let me know if you have any questions.
