For January, I moved 2 deals from Trco Non NY to CGAS/WGL meter 78-30.
Both  deals are sales to New Power.
Deal Volume 377268 5 (yes thats right 5 dt's) 377264 475  Kimat, you need to do some of that voodoo economic stuff because this deal  has hedges.
Joann & Alvin, this will not be part of the Citygate deal for Choice, this is  a citygate sale to New Power at WGL.
Dave, where are my New Power golf shirts, one for me, one for my sidekick  Scott.
