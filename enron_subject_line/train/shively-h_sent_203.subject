Technical issues  1) When some of the members of the chat room begin to talk, their microphone  volume starts to trail off.
2) Many of the users use the ctrl button in their daily activities.
The talk  button needs to be changed to an F# key.
3) We have trouble with latency.
Please contract Brent Tiner to help with these issues.
Thank You
