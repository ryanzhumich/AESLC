I've taken a stab at revising the consent agreement to reflect the following  changes:  Adding a material adverse effect clause - Lisa/Rose, I paraphrased on this.
Making the consent effective the later or signing or financing.
I have ZERO pride in authorship.
This is based on ESA, but I would think  would apply to TP as well.
I think we should get this to GE no later than 1000 am tomorrow if at all  possible.
