I'd like to enroll in the Enron Savings Plan program; however, when I was  navigating through the savings plan website, I started wondering if the  retirement plan and the self-directed brokerage account are the same thing.
I  think you probably have some information regarding these plans.
Could I  borrow that later this afternoon, or even better, sit down with you for a  minute to clarify which plans I am eligible to enroll in and when?
Thanks in  advance for your time.
Kate
