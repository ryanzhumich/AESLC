Cindy/CNG is looking at the park and loan deal.
She laughed when I said gave  her the volume of 100,000.
The most she will consider is 50,000.
So I told  her to look at a total storage volume of 50,000 and ENA would pay $4500.00 in  demand charges each month.
She needs to think about it.
I'm out tomorrow  but I will call her.
Also, we are actually looking at -25,000 to 25,000 and we would be billed
