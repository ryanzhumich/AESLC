Peter: Weyerhaeuser Company Limited, a company located in Ontario, wants to change  the standard securities rep that we have in our current ISDA Schedule to the  following:  "It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities  Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives."
Our current rep is  attached.
Is this something that we can agree to?
