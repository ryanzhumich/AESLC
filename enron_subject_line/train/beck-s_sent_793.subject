Did you get the changes that we discussed yesterday included before the  response to the RFP went to CMS?
Also, please send me a copy of the complete response to the RFP, assuming you  have that.
You mentioned yesterday that the document we were reviewing was  only part of the package.
I would like to see the whole thing.
Thanks.
