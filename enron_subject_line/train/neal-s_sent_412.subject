Kathy Kelly EXCELLENT    The performance of the group in the area of  operations/logistics is superior.
Kathy is able to manage multiple tasks and  is able to get performance form her people.
Even with the dramatic growth  of  our business, the ops group has been able to manage to sustain a very  high level of performance.
I think Kathy could improve in the commercial  area (idetifying important data/market info) and thinking of ways to improve  our business model though systems, organizational structure, etc..  Ed Terry  SASTIFACTORY/STRONG   Similar comments as above in the area of  operations/logistics.
Ed's scope is fairly narrow, very centered to  operations/logistics.
I would like Ed to improve his ability/wllingness to  make decisions.
Very little commercial understanding, although shows  interest in learning.
