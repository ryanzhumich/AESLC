Tana and I were unable to find anything useful here.
David Mitchell thought  he might find something for us in his files and will send it to us but as he  remembers it, we never got very far with the details.
He probably just  advised that if we ever did set up a CTA that it should be completely  separate - both in legal entity and staff - from our trading activities and  should be Chinese Wall fenced  as well.
I'll send over whatever we receive  from him and warned him that you might be calling.
