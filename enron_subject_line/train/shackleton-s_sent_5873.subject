Stewart:  I spoke with Rawleigh White (Tribal CFO) and the Tribe's outside counsel the  other day.
Pending receipt of Tracy's credit worksheet, I'll send the  Tribe/lawyers a "sample ISDA without credit" which is not specific to the  Tribe.
The lawyers will begin to determine if the Tribe is an "eligible  contract participant" for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.
Rawleigh wants to know if Enron is interested in helping the Tribe finance  the purchase of the two dams.
Can you please address for West Origination  and respond to Raleigh?
Thanks.
