Robert,   Ken developed an industrial report before he left.
It can be found at  o/logistics/kenseaman/industrialsmonthly/...
There is one file for each  month of 2000.
I need you to update this for March.
This will need to be  distributed to Gas Control, Logistics, and myself.
Let me know if you have  any questions.
