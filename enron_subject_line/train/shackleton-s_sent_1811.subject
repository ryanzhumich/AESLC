Molly:  I left you a voice mail this morning about Citibank.
The file  reflects that you received correspondence from Citibank on 2/22/00 and Carol  St. Clair had propsed revisions to the existing 1/9/96 ISDA Master Agreement  (including changes to the CSA).
Have you agreed to those changes?
The  Australia office is inquiring about the status of this Master Agreement.
Thanks.
Sara
