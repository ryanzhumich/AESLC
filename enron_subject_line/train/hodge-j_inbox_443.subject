Kelley,  I am writing to you to follow up on our discussion last week regarding disclosure of counterparty names for price verification purposes.
Can you give me the name and contact information for the person within your company that would work with us to put a Confidentiality Agreement in place.
Jeff Hodge is our lawyer who will work on this for Enron.
Jeff can contacted at 713 853-6911 or by email at jeffrey.t.hodge@enron.com.
Thanks for you assistance.
