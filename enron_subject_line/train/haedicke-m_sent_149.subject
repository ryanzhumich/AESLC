I will be in Tokyo next week working on the start-up of energy trading in  Japan for Enron.
I would like to book time on your respective schedules to  meet on Wednesday afternoon.
I have some flexibility in my schedule if that  does not work for you.
I will be in Tokyo on Thursday and Friday too.
Look  foward to hearing from you.
