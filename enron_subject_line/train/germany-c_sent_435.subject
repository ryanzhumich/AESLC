Crystal confirmed that items coded as a demand charge on physical forward  deals in the "External Column" do not show up in our P&L.
Example:  See deal 113266, sale to Reliant.
I was concerned that we would  double dip the reimbursements for transport demand charges if I show  reimbursements on the transport sheet and we include the reimbursements on  the Physical Forward sale as well.
