Meredith, I see both of the Bay States deals in Unify on the 31st.
I  remember chatting with deal clearing about it yesterday.
Could you path  those deals and email Mark when you are done.
Mark, I'm expecting you to see the amount of the invoice come across in Unify  after Meredith paths the gas.
Just a note, we will probably be billed  interest because the payment is late.
I think it was due on 2/26/2000.
