I realize that the timing of the Enron Net Works All Employee Meeting last Friday made it difficult for the Gas Logistics Team to attend.
For future all-employee events within ENW, we will try to schedule times that work best for all employees.
I didn't want you to be left out in this case, so I have worked with Bob Superty to set up another meeting for the Logistics team so that we can share with you the information that was covered last Friday.
I hope that you will be able to join me for this second meeting.
We have two videos that were made for the all-employee meeting that I think you will enjoy seeing.
We will also review the slides that were used in the discussions and have time for questions and answers.
