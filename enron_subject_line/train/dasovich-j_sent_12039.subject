What people know:  Hertzberg (et al's) bill (82XX)was heard in an "informational" hearing today  and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.
It will be heard again  tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a  chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.
Most, including us, oppose  unless significantly amended.
