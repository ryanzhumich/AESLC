RBoyle@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:   The  rescheduling of the October Reconfiguration Auction of TCCs due to the events of September 11th has produced some unanticipated consequences.
The NYISO will  not be able to post the results of Round 3 of the Initial Autumn 2001 TCC Auction  as  scheduled.
The  results of Round 3 will be posted by noon on Monday, September  24,  2001.
The  Bidding Period for Round 4 of the auction will commence on Tuesday, September 25, 2001 at 8:00 AM and continue to 9:00 PM Eastern Standard  Time.
The  Bidding  Period has been extended to provide auction participants additional time to assess their Bidding strategy.
The  remainder  of  the schedule for the Initial Autumn 2001 TCC Auction is unchanged.
