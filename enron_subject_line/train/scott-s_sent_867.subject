Given that tonight's weather conditions may not permit dining alfresco, I was  wondering if we should come up with an alternative plan.
I think the first  order of business is whether or not we want to go some place we can eat or if  everyone just wants to meet up post dinner.
Depending on everyone's  preferences I have several suggestions.
Let me know your thoughts (regarding  tonight).
