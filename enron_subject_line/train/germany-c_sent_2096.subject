Attached is my pricing and the capacity for December.
I went thru the  capacity fairly close on CGAS so this should be correct.
Let me know if you  have any questions.
Also, for the 1st,  I'm showing a FOM volume of 31,679 dth per day.
This is  a combination of your max FOM Exhibit 1 gas, plus the CGLF volume plus some  NX1 CGAS volumes.
