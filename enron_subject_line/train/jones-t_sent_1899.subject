On the 9/11/00 list, Credit wants to open Ontario Power to trade financial  power, but I cannot until we speak to Canadian outside counsel.
They are  part of the split up of Ontario Hydro, which was the Province of Ontario, and  obviously, a governmental, before the split up.
They are still a wholly  owned sub of a governmental and we cannot open them up until we talk to  outside counsel about the governmental issues.
I have a call into Canadian  counsel right now.
Also, on the 9/8/00 list, Sempra Energy Solution called me to find out when  they could trade, so if you could open them up pronto...
