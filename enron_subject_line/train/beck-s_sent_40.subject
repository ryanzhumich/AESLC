I had to report for jury duty today (along with 500 others from Harris   County), and to my surprise I was selected to be a juror in a felony case.
The case will continue on Wednesday, so our scheduled time for a conference  call may not work.
I will try to reach you from my car while I am on my way  in for jury duty - probably around 8:30 or 9:00 Houston time.
