Luanne: I made a mistake on the language that we sent you on MAC.
On the last part  where it talks about a failure to be rated, my understanding from our  discussions is that a MAC would only be triggered if a party's credit support  provider failed to be rated by either S&P or Moody's  so that if it lost one  rating but maintained the other rating a MAC would not be triggered.
For  this reason the amendment should read ...or its Credit Support Provider shall  fail to have a rating from either S&P or Moody's.
Please confirm that this is your understanding and sorry for the confusion.
