John,  I have received your message regarding Mike Roberts.
I could not agree more.
Mike deserves to be compensated for his exceptional contribution.
Additional recommendation.
I think that all weather forecasting support should be consolidated under Mike (including the weather guys supporting  power trading).
In my view, it was a mistake to remove Mike from power support.
It would also mean a lot to him personally.
Vince
