Hey guys ,,,, thankyou very much for the baby outfits... Heather and I both  loved them......  We can't wait for you guys to meet him.......  We took him  to the doctor today for his two week chk up and he weighed 9.5 lbs.
That is  up over a pound....  he eats like a horse and is very healthy.... the next  goal is to get him to sleep at night!
