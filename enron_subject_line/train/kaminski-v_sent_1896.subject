Geynille,  I understand you are in charge of recruiting at the UofH.
I am forwarding to  you the resume  of one of the students  of the University of Houston.
She is involved with the international organization called AIESEC and I was  most impressed by her organizational skills and professional attitude.
I used to work as a volunteer for this organization many years ago and I am still helping their local chapter.
As far as I know, she signed up for an interview with Enron.
