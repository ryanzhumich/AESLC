Bill:  We are proposing the following compromise language to the bank  regarding "Transfer":   Party A may transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in  whole but not in part, to any Affiliate that is a resident for income tax  purposes of the United States or Canada.......  We typically don't resrict the jurisdiction of our Affiliates.
Is this O.K.
with you?
