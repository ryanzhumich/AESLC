Please join us for an informal lunch on Friday, July 21st in the dining room  in EB50M.
Rick Causey, Enron's executive lead for the Analyst Program, and  David Haug, Enron's executive lead for the Associates Program, have been  invited to join us as well.
We are interested in renewing acquaintances with  those of you whom we met on campus and in getting to know those of you whom  we did not see in the interview process.
We hope that you are enjoying your  summer assignments at Enron and we look forward to the opportunity to visit  over lunch.
Please let me know by return e:mail if you will be able to attend the lunch.
