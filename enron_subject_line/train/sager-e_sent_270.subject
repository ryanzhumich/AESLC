FYI  - I wanted you to know that, despite all appearances, we are working on  finalizing Shari's move to Portland.
Shari is looking for a "relocation"  package.
HR has been tied up in PRC and is now searching for a package that  works.
HR has promised me a response today and then I can discuss w Mark H  and then present to Shari.
End of Feb is still the target date.
Hope all well (despite the press).
