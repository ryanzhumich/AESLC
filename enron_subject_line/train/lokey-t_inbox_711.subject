Hi Teb,  I am trying to verify if Jeanette Doll is still on assignment.
Listed below are the Co #s and CC #s that Jeanette has been charging her time to.
Could you validate if these cost center numbers are still active or inactive?.
Is the Company Name and Department the same?
Also, please let me know if there are any cost center numbers that need to be added or deleted.
Transwestern	GPG-TW Rates	0060	111004	  Lastly, is there a tentative end date for this assignment?
Thanks!
