In its preliminary notice of November maintenance, El Paso had scheduled Lines 1300 and 1301 on the San Juan Crossover for total shutdown Nov. 29-30.
It said Wednesday the shutdown has been delayed to coincide with the Dec. 1-2 weekend, when all 650 MMcf/d of the crossover's capacity will be cut to zero.
Portions of Line 1300 will be shutting down Dec. 11-12 and Dec. 18-19; capacity cuts then will be 60 MMcf/d.
