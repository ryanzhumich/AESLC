Dan, in response to the following memo, can you discuss with Rick his ideas.
I would also like to go through a detailed description of each EES office, its people and functions to determine which should be eliminated and which should be modified.
Given the latest redeployments and terminations the field offices are a shadow of their previous stature either way.
This is consistent with our overall strategies but perhaps we want to accelerate.
If you could help set up the framework to discuss I would much appreciate.
Good job on handling the "5's".
Regards
