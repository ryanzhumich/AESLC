When you get back in we need to talk about this cpy.
My records had them  shut down for power, they called about contract issue and wanting to trade in  all products areas, and speaking to Shari and checking your notes, you had  them as open.
Since they haven't traded power yet, I had Frank shut them  down until I confirm with you they're OK and under what contracts.
Talk to you when you get back...
