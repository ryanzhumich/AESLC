Jim: We have finally devised a procedure for handling termination rights.
I will  amend the ETA amendment letter and send it to you.
We have a new procedure  in place that requires me to get commercial approval for all amendments so I  first will need to run this by the head of the Online group but will send it  to you right after I receive that approval.
Sorry for the delay.
