Please find attached referenced lists.
It is not clear to me yet how we are  going to deal with Australian approvals, so I think at this point you need to  look to Australia for approval of their counterparties.
Also, there were no  counterparties to approve on 3/16/00 so that list is not attached.
I haven't said it in a while...but no European power for US counterparties...
