Kathy-  I got your message.
Kali has been going to the Thursday practices, with the  exception of the last three weeks due to rainout, spring break and a going  away party for a friend.
She'll be there on this Thursday.
Do you have a  uniform for her?
Maybe she would feel part of the team if she gets a shirt  and has that for the next game.
I'll try to work on her.
Thanks,
