As you have probably observed, power markets have been severely tested this  summer.
There are many underlying causes (demand growth driven by a strong  economy, failure of regulators to quickly grant applications for new  generation, inadequate access to the grid, rate regulation which continues to  insulate end users from real time price signals, etc.).
But, the soundbite  on these troubles has been that deregulation has led to problems on the  grid.
The knee jerk policy response has been price caps and other threats of  re-regulation.
At the upcoming advisory council meeting, Ken and I were hoping that the two  of you could discuss the issue and help put it in perspective:  How great of a threat is re-regulation.
How might we respond.
How likely is this issue to play a significant role in election politics?
