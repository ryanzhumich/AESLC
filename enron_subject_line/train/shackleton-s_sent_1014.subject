Susan:  You may be aware of this database already.
I remembered it but as= =20 Nony's message indicates below, I think I lost the link.
We need to keep= =20 this link in mind (as well as updates since Alan has just updated Japan, fo= r=20 example) when identifying resources for swap lawyers.
I'll schedule a shor= t=20 meeting for us to recap soon.
