During the budgeting process for 2001 I gave Dave Delainey an estimated cost  savings for Energy Operations assuming the sale of HPL.
Since this is clearly  on the horizon, we need to take a close look at opportunities for cost  savings and our estimated timing on those savings.
I will ask James by copy  of this memo to set up a meeting late this week to cover this.
I want to be  able to get back with Dave with more detailed estimates of cost savings.
