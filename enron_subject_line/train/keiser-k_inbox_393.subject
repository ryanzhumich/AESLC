Hey guys just thought I would let you know that Valero is going to be at the Job Fair this Friday at Enron Field from 1-4 and I will be one of the people attending it to represent us.
So if you are going to be there make sure you come by and at least say hello.
Plus depending on when my flight back is going to be and how soon I can leave the Fair we plan on going somewhere and getting a couple of drinks.
So come by drop off a resume and maybe we can get some drinks.
Note:  If you are interested in Valero there is a very good possibility that the Director of Mid-Office will be attending as well and it would be a good chance for an informal interview.
Hope everybody is doing alright and pass the word on to anybody I may have missed.
Kyle
