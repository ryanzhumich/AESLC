Here's what I've come up with so far on these deals.
There are just two more  that are going to require a little bit more attention - 566426 and 566391 -  the SP-15 deals for 4/2.
I'm sorry it's taken me a few days to get back to  you on this.
Please let me know what you think, and we'll go from there.
Thanks,
