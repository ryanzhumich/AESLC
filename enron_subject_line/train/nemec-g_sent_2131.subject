Attached is a revised petition which includes the section of ECS' discussions  with WFEC.
Please review.
I sending out this draft for the sake of saving  time without review by my clients and am asking them to review as well.
I  assume the next step is for Jeff to revise the conclusion with the bullets  points and circulate a final draft for everyone's review.
Let me know if  this is not the case.
Thanks for your help.
