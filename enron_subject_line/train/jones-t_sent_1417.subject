Just as we got the assignment of the natgas trades in, I got a call from  Anita Herrera, the attorney for Statoil, saying she is sending me an  assignment of the crude trades tomorrow.
It won't be as painful a process,  since she told me we they only have one or two crude trades left on the  books.
Anyway, I wanted to give you a head's up (and maybe to keep any  collateral you might have to cover the crude trades!
)...
