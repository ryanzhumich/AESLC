Rob: On the recording language issue, we can agree to the following:  Instead of  limiting it to trading, marketing and scheduling personnel, we can agree that  it is limited to all telephone communications that are made to or from each  party's trading floor.
This is because all calls that originate out of our  trading area are always recorded no matter who picks up on the other line.
Does that work for you?
I'm still checking on the confirmation/transaction  tape issue.
Also, our credit person will agree to the Moody's trigger in the  MAC language that we discussed.
