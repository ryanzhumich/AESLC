Eric,   I recieved a call from a guy with Pacific Interlink (?).
He is looking to  market LNG in Europe.
Since I have very little knowledge in this area, I  didn't get much specific information.
But, I told him I would find someone  for him to talk with.
His name is Sam Kovacevich.
Phone:  847-971-3369.
I  would appreciate it if you would give Sam a call.
If you aren't the person  he needs to talk to, please let me know.
Thanks.
