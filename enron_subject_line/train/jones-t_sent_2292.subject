I spoke to Ed Sacks in Credit re: AEP.
We have an ISDA in place with AEP  Energy Services, Inc.
When they trade under that master they are trading for  their own account.
When they trade as American Electric Power Service  Corporation they are actually trading as the service company for the family  of utilities under their umbrella.
So it's 2 different counterparties.
