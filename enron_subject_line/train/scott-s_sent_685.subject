Dolores,  I was wondering who my best resource would be to talk to about the changes to  the analyst program and how they affect me.
Specifically, I wanted to get  some more information on the Third-Year Analyst Rotation and its requirements  (as I am currently half-way through my second rotation), as well as the  different tracks available within the program.
If you could direct to the  proper individual(s) I would really appreciate it.
Thanks,
