Kim,  Please review this draft.
I have not modified any language from the Enfolio  to that contained in the draft of their form of contract which you forwarded  to me last week.
I will read their long form and see if it makes sense to  include their language.
Remember, in their short form, they had language for  short breaks which was slightly diffent from ours but with a little torture,  we could have incorporated their language once we got over the hurdle that we  can't agree to let them audit our contracts,  which means we could never show  them what we got for the default quantity.
