Steve/Christian,  The attached file is a draft of an asset management agreement prepared by Stu  Zisman.
The later version obviously contained more negotiated points, so I  think this one is more helpful.
I'm working on a transaction now which involves serving load as well as  selling power.
I found this one helpful for issue identification and  exculpatory language, however.
