Hi Dede   I got your email about NY seminar.
Great idea but sorry we can't be of much  help - I haven't touched EEI since the Houston seminar.
I know its time to  start trying to use it.
Oh well, next week's project.
On a more important note, do you want to try and hit this Tuesday (the 4th)  at lunch?
Let me know.
Hope you have fun on Friday night.
