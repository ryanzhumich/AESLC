Sorry I couldn't make it for cake last night.
I had to work late last  night...Big Shock!!!
Anyway, hope it was fun and that you're having a great  week.
Mine has been pretty busy work wise.
I'm sure you're curious about  Mr. Noble.
All I can say right now is that, while I definitely still like  him (we had a great time Sunday), I am some what annoyed with him right  now...he's been very wishy-washy the first half of this week.
I'm not real  sure what I'm going to do about it, but I'm sure I'll think of something.
