In order to complete the approved list of counterparties fo the new online  trading system I need a list of master agreements you have negotiated that do  not have all the necessary representations (e.g.
trade option exemption) and  definition references to permit trading energy commodity derivatives.
Friday  noon would be soon enough.
Thanks,
