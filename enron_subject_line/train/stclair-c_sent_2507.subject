Pablo and Jose: Thanks for the update.
Based on the marketing information that you received  from us yesterday, are there any restrictions on our folks in Mexico going  forward with their marketing efforts?
If so, please advise.
Prior to  receiving you written advice, would it be possible to schedule a call maybe  on Wednesday of next week with myself and Jaime so that we can at least  outline any potential online issues, both in connection with our marketing  efforts and in connection with the online documents that you are reviewing?
I  am available anytime after 2:30 (Houston time) on Wednesday and I am wide  open on Thursday.
