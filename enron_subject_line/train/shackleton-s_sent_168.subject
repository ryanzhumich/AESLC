The confirmation desk recently received a call from Mike Billings who I  believe is your Dow trader.
Mike is trying to trade financially under the  name "The Dow Chemical Company".
ECT SHOULD CONTINUE TO TRADE FINANCIALLY  WITH "DOW HYDROCARBONS AND RESOURCES INC" (the party that ECT has a Master  Agreement with).
ECT will NOT agree to change the counterparty on any future  trades.
When you speak with Mike Billings, you may alert him to this.
Thanks.
