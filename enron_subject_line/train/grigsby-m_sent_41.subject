Please write up a ticket transferring my CIG and WIC April physical positions  to IM denver.
I will be selling CIG index to Jay at CIG index flat and  buying the 2000/d at CIG index minus .03.
Also, run a report of all my term  index positions at CIG and WIC for the summer, so that we can transfer these  to Jay as well.
Thanks,
