Attached is a clean and redlined copy of the CIG agreement with my  revisions.
The redline is compared against the version you had forwarded  earlier via email.
Sorry for the delay.
I will be at the ENA Legal  Conference this afternoon and tomorrow.
Please leave a voicemail if you have  any questions.
Thanks.
