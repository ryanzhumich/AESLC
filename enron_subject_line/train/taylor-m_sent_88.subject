Richard:  In the US we have changed our swap agreement forms to provide for arbitration  in order to avoid having to explain the intricacies of derivatives trading to  judges or, God forbid, juries.
In Canada we are continuing to submit to the  jurisdiction of Canadian courts (on the theory that there are no juries in  civil actions and arbitration is rarely used in Canadian contracts  generally).
As we are presently in the process of revising our UK swap  agreement forms, I guess it's time to revisit the issue as it applies to UK  agreements.
Currently we agree to UK law and the jurisdiction of UK courts  (where there are no juries in civil actions).
Should this continue to be our  policy or should we begin going for arbitration in the UK contracts also?
I  would ask Paul and Scott to let Richard and me know if arbitration is widely  enough used in UK agreements that we can get away with asking for it.
Thanks,
