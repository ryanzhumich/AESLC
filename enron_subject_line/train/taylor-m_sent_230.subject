Hey Jeff:  I just saw your email address on the Monmouth web site.
I didn't realized  you were at Mayer Brown.
I don't even know if we've talked since I left New  York (almost 5 years ago).
I'm now in the legal department at Enron Capital  & Trade Resources in Houston where my group is responsible for the legal  issues in derivatives trading here.
I don't get to Chicago often but if they  ever send you down this way, be sure to look me up!
C., F. & S.,  Mark
