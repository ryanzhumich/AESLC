Good News:  Lenny weakening - max.
winds down to 130 mph and pressure rising Bad News:  The darn thing won't get moving - still just drifting a bit to the  north & east  It's hard to describe which islands we care about on those maps - they're all  so small they almost don't show up on the maps.
Luckily St. Thomas is to the  west and a bit north of Lenny's current position  Here is a San Juan radar image that has St. Thomas marked and one of th  recent forecasted path maps.
