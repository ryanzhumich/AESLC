I think Sitara deal 286147 is not pulling the correct price in Unify.
The  reference price is NWPL.RKYMTNS.GDP.DA and the particular month in question  is 06/00.
When I look in the Tables database under June, there is no price.
And what was pulled for the invoice back in June I don't think is correct.
Please let me know what you find out.
Thanks.
