I know how much you're looking forward to "Ted's Weekend of Rest and  Relaxation" and I also realize that carting me back and forth to the car  dealership wasn't exactly on your list of things to do (bear in mind the  dealership is roughly 5 minutes from your apartment)...So, I'm offering you  an out.
I can find someone else to help me if you want to bail (I know how  important your pool-side time is - Remember it's all about you and your  needs."
Just let me know.
FYI:  Galveston does not look like this...
