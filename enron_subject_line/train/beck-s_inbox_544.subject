Sally:   I enjoyed the ENW presentation this morning, it looks like a great place to be.
I am on the UT campus recruiting team and I know a strong candidate that I feel would be a very good fit for an IT position in ENW.
He graduated this May and has been trying unsuccessfully for make contact with Enron recruiters for some time.
Could you possibly pass on this resume to an appropriate person in recruiting?
Thanks for the help.
