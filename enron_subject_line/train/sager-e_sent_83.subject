Hi John  Thanks for WSJ article.
Now if only you could notify senior management over  here and let them know I would forever indebted (but hopefully richer as  well).
TVA has sent us a system impact study agreement that I am having faxed to you  now.
We have to send out on Thursday.
Do you have time to review and we can  discuss tomorrow.
Thanks
