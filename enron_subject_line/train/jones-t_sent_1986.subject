Chris,  Per our conversation, I am attaching  a sample form of ISDA for both a  Canadian corporate and a Canadian governmental.
With the governmental, the  proposed form of legal opinion attached to the ISDA Schedule would have to be  modified depending on your particular situtation (see footnotes in opinion).
As I also mentioned, we are making some revisions to the guaranty we are  getting from Hydro-Quebec in response to comments from counsel, and we may  want to make some of the same changes to guarantees we receive from any  governmental guarantor.
If you end up having a governmental guarantor, let  me know and I'll send you down the revisions.
By copy of this email to Joe Hunter on the Confirmation Desk, I am asking him  to email you copies of the form of Omnibus Confirmation and Annex A thereto  for an ECC/Canadian Counterparty Deal.
I have to say that if you end up  transacting with a governmental entity, our form of confirmation will not  include the reps and warranties required to transact with such  counterparties, since we never trade financial with governmentals prior to  execution of a master.
If you go down that road we may have to come up with  some kind of form, but the best route is to get the ISDA in place first.
