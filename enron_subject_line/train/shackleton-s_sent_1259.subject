Carol:  I spoke with Richard Peterson (retail side).
Apparently we were  dealing with the exploration side of the company last year.
We agreed to (1)  mark up the Flying J form AND (2) reissue the Industrial Master that had been  negotiated last year (with our form changes).
John Scales (exploration side)  wouldn't agree to the MAC at the last minute.
Do you want to handle?
Just  let me know.
