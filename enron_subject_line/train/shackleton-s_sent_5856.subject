Susan:  This may look confusing!
It contains all of our "choices" for  preparing the documents.
See Part 2 (Tax Reps) and the end of the document  which has our "choices" of tax forms.
I thought it might be helpful to be very basic about withholding issues,  etc., why we need the tax reps, and what questions we could ask upfront about  a party that would help us select an appropriate tax module.
We tend to not  "think" and expect a party "fill in the blank" when we are preparing draft  documents.
