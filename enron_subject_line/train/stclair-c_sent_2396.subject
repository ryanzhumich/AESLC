Sarah: I just wanted to thank you for the time and effort that you have spent on my  behalf in trying to resolve this ratings situation.
I know that Bill S. is  still trying to plead my case today with Cindy Benson, but I am afraid that  the damage was done when Memorial's team captain voiced her objection.
Why  do you think that she did what she did and won't this happen again when we  play them?
I look forward to hearing from you.
