Charlene,  Please, help.
This is a son of a professor at Berkeley who helps me a lot in  the recruiting process.
His son goes to Cornell.
Can we invite him (the son, not the professor) to a  Super Saturday?
I really want to repay the debt to his father who is very instrumental in  my recruiting  efforts.
