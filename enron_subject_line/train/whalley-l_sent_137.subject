Jim,  Greg received a faxed copy of a slide on ENA - Wholesale Power Network from  Kathyn Corbally.
The slide gives a comparison in physical power volumes with  1st Quarter 99 vs. 1st Quarter 2000.
The slides shows a 5% percent increase  and Greg thought that you mentioned that the increase was closer to 20%.
Please advise.
Liz
