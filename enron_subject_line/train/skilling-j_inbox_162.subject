Hi Jeff.
I am Mike's brother, Ronnie, living in San Diego and a member of the San Diego Chapter of YPO.
With all the propaganda being spread about the electricity and energy crisis we are experiencing here in California, I thought it would be worthwhile to invite you to town to give us an insider's view on what is really going on (aka, the "truth").
Is there anyway you can find time in your busy schedule to visit us over dinner with a short talk and a question and answer period.
The sooner the better.
I will schedule a "special" meeting of our chapter to accommodate any dates that work for you.
I look forward to hearing from you.
