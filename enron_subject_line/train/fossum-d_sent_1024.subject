I believe you got a copy of the John Sommer letter to producers dated Jan 6  that MKM's spies intercepted.
She forwarded the Sommer letter to Stan and  discussed it with him.
Dari and I vented our aggravation by drafting the  attached letter to Gibson and Kyle complaining of Sommer's duplicity, but  after tempers cooled, MKM and I decided not to send it to  Stan or urge him  to send a written response.
As it stands, MKM and I will probably bring it  up with Sommer in OK City and strongly suggest the importance of coordinated  communication to the producers.
Stan may also bring the letter up orally  next time he's on the phonne with Gibson or Kyle as an example of how not to  handle this situation.
