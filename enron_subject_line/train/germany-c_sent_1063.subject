Dynergi released the CGAS capcity to us for one month so we could do it non  bidable.
Scott, it looks recallable.
Its parcel number 28464.
Vol=7500,  receipt point is Leach, delivery point is City of Richmond.
The rate is  $2.40 = $.08.
Everything looks good except the recallable factor.
Also, there is a small NYSEG release for 24 dt's at max rate, offer #28446.
I can't get my machine to print out the forms.
Good Luck.
