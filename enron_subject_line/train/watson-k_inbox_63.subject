Attached is SoCal's filing of their peaking service for bypass customers including the specific rates by customer class.
Given the recent press with the dissatisfaction of the rates by Questar/Southern Trails, I would expect they will protest the Advice Letter filing.
I'll continue to monitor the proceeding and any protests filed.
