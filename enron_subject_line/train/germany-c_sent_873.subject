I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts.
I am entereing these fuel  waivers on the primary capacity deal in Sitara.
Do I need to enter them on  the secondary capacity deal ticket?
Also, I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing  from the Gulf (East Region) to CNG (Market East Region).
Which transport  capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on?
