David:  I am inquiring to see if you would be available for a short  conference call tomorrow with a few credit related items.
I cannot recall  the exact time difference between Houston and Geneva, but I can contact you  at 9 am Houston time (or later as you wish).
I have your phone number as  4122 3221111.
Please advise.
Regards.
Sara
