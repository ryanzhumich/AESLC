I spoke to Greg Johnston, one of the Canadian lawyers who is currently  seconded here, and have determined the following:  Imperial Oil Resources is an Alberta limited partnership.
All Canadian  transactions are entered into with this counterparty.
Imperial Oil Resources Limited is the General Partner of Imperial Oil  Resources.
We do not transact business with this entity.
