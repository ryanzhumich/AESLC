Mike,  You may recall that I have asked that Brent Hendry, an attorney in our Buenos  Aires office, be given access to our Lotus Notes Master Swap Agreement  Database and that appears not to have happened yet.
Can you please let me  and Brent know what needs to be done to grant hims access.
Brent will also need additional attorneys added to the database.
Brent, can  you provide Mike with a list of any other individuals  (Legal/Credit/Secretarial only) you would like granted access.
Mike, it also appears Brent would like to copy our database to set up a  document tracking database in B.A.
Who should he contact here to get a new  database created similar to ours?
Thanks for your help!
