Dan,  Attached are the drafts with the Collection Facilities language.
Blank  exhibits for the Security Agreement Form and Insurance requirements.
Will  forward as soon as I am able to obtain them.
Let me know if you have any  questions.
Dan,  Could you ask Denise if all the Lease Agreement are the same form.
If  not, I need to see all of them.
