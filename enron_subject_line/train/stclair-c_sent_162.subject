Lucy: Sara and I met with Mark today to talk in part about the concerns I had about  the HDD info that third parties had requested us to provide.
He wants us to  talk to you and the group further about this because there are risks  associated with us giving this info to third parties if a portion of such  info is info that we fill in based on our internal knowledge.
I'm out  tomorrow and this afternoon is hectic so I would very much like to have this  discussion at our Monday morning meeting.
does everyone on your side know  about the meeting at 10:30 and can they attend?
If that time is a problem,  please contact my assistant Suzanne Adams.
Carol
