Unfortunately the Dream Matchup has been nixed by the Cotton Bowl.
UT is no  longer in consideration for a Cotton Bowl berth.
It would have been fun to  see how you fare against a top 5 team.
Maybe we will see you next year.
Of course, you will have to make it to the  Rose Bowl.
Good luck in Dallas!
