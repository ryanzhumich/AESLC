Jeff, this Agreement should replace the GISB and any other gas agreement between the parties.
The collateral language is incorporated into the document.
Also, with respect to the Collateral Agreement for Duke Energy Merchants LLC ("DEM"), Duke would like to propose assigning all of the Enron transactions with DEM into one Enron entity and then using the form of collateral agreement submitted to ENA (with some tweaking to allow for a Guaranty from Duke Capital Corporation) to cover the transactions between the Enron counterparty and DEM.
Duke can present a list of companies which it has outstanding transactions with if Enron would like.
Please let me know if you have any questions in this regard.
Thanks - Joe  (See attached file: DETM Master 10-29-01.doc)  - DETM Master 10-29-01.doc
