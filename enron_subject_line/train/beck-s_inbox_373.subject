Sally  Thanks for all your time in Houston and I'd be delighted to continue discussions around commercialisation whenever you want.
As promised, please find attached examples of our monthly management reporting.
They are still evolving - at the moment they are missing aged debtors / creditors reporting (we should get in for June reporting once the function moves back into my area) and anything on Enron Credit.
However, comments and thoughts welcome!
Kind regards
