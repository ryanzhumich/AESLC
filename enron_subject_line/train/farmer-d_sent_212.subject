Esther,   Gary asked me to send this info to you for the business trip that I've  invited him on.
Enron employees will be leaving at 11:30am on Continental flight #1668 from  Bush Intercontinental on Friday 8/4/00.
The return flight from Tampa will be Continental #1663 leaving Tampa at 3:20  pm on Sunday, arriving in Houston at 4:29pm.
I believe that there are a couple of later flights on Friday (around 1:30 and  3:30) if Gary needs to come in for a part of the day.
I will probably have  to catch one of the later ones, but Gary is welcome to go whenever he likes.
If you have any questions, give me a call @ 36905.
Daren
