Steve: I think I already forward these to you, but if not, they're the prices that  Henderson came up with for fully shaped prices to the utilities.
May be  useful re: conversations with the Street about getting the utilities out of  procurement.
Note that the date on the prices is 10.02.00 so they're  somewhat stale, but arguably still indicative.
I'm also going to give you  the prices Belden just gave us (prior to the run up yesterday, though) for  prices at SP15.
Best,
