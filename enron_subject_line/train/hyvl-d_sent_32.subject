Richard Sanders and I talked with Elizabeth (an attorney with AEP).
She was  not sure that their was a question that needed to be answered.
Richard  opined that the question may have related to the effect on HPL if it lost the  Taub lawsuit.
This suit relates to an alleged violation of the surface  rights agreement (Collateral Agreement) which was entered into with certain  surface owners after the Unit Agreement was signed.
Richard explained that  if HPL lost the suit, it would lose its rights to maintain a pipeline and  well facilities on the property subject to the lawsuit.
In that event HPL  would have to either locate its pipeline around the property or  use its  condemnation rights to acquire an easement across the property.
Because the  Collateral Agreement relates to surface rights, losing those rights would not  affect HPL's rights under the Unit Agreement and thus the Taubs would not  have the right to drill a well to produce the gas that HPL has in storage.
