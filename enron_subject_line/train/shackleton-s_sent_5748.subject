Mark:  I just received a copy of my "IOU/municipal" chart from last year with  an undated note from you about our omnibus format/IOU's.
I would like to  speak with you especially since I'm speaking with credit about municipals on  Wednesday.
As a practical matter, I'm not sure whether we even transact with utilities  on the omnibus.
Perhaps Tana can answer the question as to online trading  and the confirmation desk as to offline trading.
Secondly, I'm not sure how  often the Additional Event of Default is successfully negotiated into the  ISDA Agreement.
The latter point might be worth an email to the lawyers.
Do you have a few minutes today?
