Jeff, as per our discussion, this would be a great opportunity for you to  spend some time with and instill your vision for Enron to the leaders of the  ENA organization.
I have attached a preliminary agenda which has you  speaking to the group right after dinner the night of December 14th.
You  have no time constraint on the length of your talk (ie) whatever you find  find appropriate in order to get your message across.
I though it might be  interesting for you to give your vision of Enron's 2001 goals, objectives and  strategy.
As well, a brief business overview of EES, EBS and Networks may be  valuable in building connections.
