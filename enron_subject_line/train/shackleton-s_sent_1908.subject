I am seeing more and more credit derivatives.
The trades originating in  Houston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in  the name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.
I can't be certain if these are  backed to EnronCredit.com Limited.
In particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ  International Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.
We have  no master with this party.
Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit  derivatives?
FYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.
