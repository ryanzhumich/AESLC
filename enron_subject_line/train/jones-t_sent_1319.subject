Attached are the referenced lists.
On the 6/19/00 list for Sithe Power  Marketing, LP, they were on the original approval list, and since they are  coming through again for SO2, and since I'm not sure if we had SO2 on the  original list, I open them up for it just in case.
Also, I opened them up  for financial, since it appears they have now met the eligible swap  participant requirements, even tho' Credit is still not opening them up for  financial.
