I have received a bill from LeBoeuf for work done in June on the ACE  insurance matter for a bit over $36,000.
This included around 23 hours by PB  Wright ($12,000) and 38 hours by SD Avitabile ($13,000).
Does that sound  right to you?
I have to allocate this to the business units - should it all  go to East Power Trading?
