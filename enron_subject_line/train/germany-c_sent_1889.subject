Effective March 1st, I moved the volumes on deal 377268 (Non NY sale to New  Power) to deal 643754 (sale to New Power at WGL on CGAS).
Please correct the  hedge information.
I also created deal 643761 (sale to New Power at WGL on CGAS).
I believe  this deal is in the index book but does not show up in Sitara.
I believe it  was originally a Z6 Non Ny sale to New Power also.
Let me know if you have any questions.
thanks
