Lisa,  I've made some preliminary suggestions on the term sheet.
We will have some  comments on the asset management attachment, but I don't have those together  yet.
In looking through our files I don't find a confidentiality agreement.
Therefore, I'm attaching a draft of what we would like to have executed so  that we can send you other documents.
Thanks,
