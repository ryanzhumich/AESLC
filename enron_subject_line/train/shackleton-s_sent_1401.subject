Maryann:  I left you a voice mail the other day regarding two typos in the  agreement and never received corrected pages.
The Guarantee has been  executed.
However, the agreement is awaiting the initials of Rod Nelson  (credit) who is on vacation until Wednesday.
Will you send corrected pages  for insertion in the document?
