The advocacy ad blitz has started.
I don't know if I have the title correct,  but the D.C. based arm of the Democratic National Committee has started an ad  campaign against Republicans (in San Diego I believe).
The head of the  committee was quoted this morning as saying something to the effect of, "the  Republicans in Washington aren't doing anything to solve the problem and "we"  want to make sure that they're held accountable."
Best,
