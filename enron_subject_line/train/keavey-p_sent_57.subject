The gas group would like to roll out some new products and new locations for  existing products in the next few weeks.
The new products are Gas Daily and Physical index trades.
I know that the Gas  Daily products currently exist but the long and short descriptions need some  work.
I should have a list of new locations shortly.
Please let me know who I need to work with to make each of these things  happen.
Thanks,
