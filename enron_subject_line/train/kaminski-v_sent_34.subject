A quick  update on the status of Sandeep Kohli.
He is working currently in my group.
He is available on a very short notice  to help you with any quantitative modeling  that can be required in making decisions regarding our DPC strategy.
In case you need his help, he can also rely on the support  of other members of my group with skills in different areas.
