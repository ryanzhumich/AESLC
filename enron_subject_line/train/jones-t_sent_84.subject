We have some files in an empty cubicle that kinda look like global contract  files.
They have global contract sheets and numbers attached to the front of  the documents in the files.
If they belong to anyone in your group they need  to be claimed now, because we are doing a cubicle restructuring this weekend  and those files will be moved and if unclaimed eventually gotten rid of.
Can  you have someone come
