Dear Dr. McMullen,  A few weeks ago I received a call from your University regarding employment opportunities at Enron.
I called back and summarized the  needs of my group (an ideal profile of a  candidate):  1. mathematical finance 2. computer programming (C, C++) 3. understanding of the energy markets  I shall appreciate any information about potential candidates.
I have also given some other suggestions regarding potential opportunities for graduates with different profiles.
