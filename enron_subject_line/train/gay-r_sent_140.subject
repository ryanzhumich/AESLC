I spoke with Dick Vincent who indicated that we will have no problem  obtaining 12 mos renewable business interruption insurance when we go  operational on gas.
This should solve the warranty issue with the banks  because it covers defects, design, and workmanship on the turbines and  includes lost profits, etc.
Incidentally, for insurance purposes the  turbines are designated DE3 which is not a new technology designation.
Typically we will always have this coverage in place but if their is a  supplier warranty then the party providing the warranty pays ahead of the  insurer.
In the case where the supplier does not pay or the warranty has  ended then the insurer will pay.
Now we just need to come up with a fix for the drop dead date.
