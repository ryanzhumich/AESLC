Laura,  Here is a draft transfer price agreement:    I'm sure we may want to add some details, etc, but at least this gives us a  beginning point.
I'm hoping that you received the revised draft of the Manlove LOI on  September 8 which incorporated your initial comments to the first draft.
We  can discuss what you see as the most efficient path forward, and any  additions, etc, you think are necessary.
I look forward to seeing you on Thursday, and breathing some cooler air for a  change.
My cell phone is 713 304 8716, should you need to reach me in the meanwhile.
I will also be checking my voicemail, but will not be picking up email.
Kay
