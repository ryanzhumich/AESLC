Cathy,  At the request of Mitch Dutton, I have reviewed the form of 311 and  intrastate gas transportation agreements provided to AEP by Duke Energy  Guadalupe Pipeline, Inc. and by EPGT Texas Pipeline, L.P.   As we discussed  this morning, these agreements appear to be the standard form of agreement  utilized by these counterparties.
Although I have no authority to approve  them for execution by AEP, had they been provided to me for execution by HPL,  I would approve them for execution.
Please note the Balancing and Penalties provision of the agreements for the  charges which these parties could impose should receipts and deliveries get  out of balance.
If time permitted I would suggest that these charges be  negotiated to something closer to the actual costs incurred by the  transporter.
However, it has been my experience that these parties are  reluctant to change the standard form for standard transportation services.
No contract documents have been provided concerning the TXU Lone Star  Pipeline.
The only documents faxed were two transportation services request  forms.
