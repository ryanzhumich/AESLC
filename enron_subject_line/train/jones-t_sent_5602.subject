I just got a call from Sheri Thomas with EnronOnline checking on the status  of your reviews.
When each of you has completed the review of your products  can you let me know, so we can sign off on that product.
Sheri is being  pressured by our traders to get this up and is also getting daily calls from  the President of Tradespark.
She would like to have everyone's sign off by  Friday if possible.
Can you let me know whether this will present any  problem.
Thanks!
