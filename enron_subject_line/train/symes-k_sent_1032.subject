Please note a change in EES reported load volume on 3/31, HE 6, SP-15.
The  volume was incorrectly copied into the worksheet, but all EnPower deals  reflect the correct number.
Also, the sheets for 3/30 and 3/31 now show those  respective dates at the top of the page.
Please let me know if there are any  questions.
