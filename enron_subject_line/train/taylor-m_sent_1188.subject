As I mentioned in my voice-mail, this needs to go somewhere that users might  actually see it - e.g.
a news ticker story.
Simply adding it to the Legal &  Privacy Statement, while helpful, is not sufficient.
EnronOnline will assist users, upon request, in arranging for direct access  connection (such as a "T1" line or other means of direct access) to  EnronOnline, as an alternative to internet access.
Direct access  connections might enable users to access EnronOnline more quickly than is  currently possible through internet access.
