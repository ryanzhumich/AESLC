Last month Lindy and I began looking into adding a provision to TW's tariff  allowing shippers to elect to purchase fuel gas from TW.
There is good  precedent for this and I think it would be fairly easy to accomplish as long  as we don't try to make the purchase of fuel from TW mandatory (see the  attached memo).
Mary Kay, as you and I discussed, we will need to address  the fuel overrecovery issue before moving forward with this.
