At the request of Mark Greenberg, I am forwarding to you the proposed  Non-Disclosure Agreement between Pricewaterhouse (for CreditDimensions) and  Enron Credit Limited.
Mark Greenberg has spoken to the counterparty and made  a few changes to Pricewaterhouse's form.
If you have any questions about the  transaction, the business person on the deal is Kim Detiveaux here in  Houston.
Otherwise, we would appreciate your assistance in getting Richard  Sage in London to execute this agreement.
