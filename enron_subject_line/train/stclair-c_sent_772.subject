Mike: I have discussed your proposed language with Brant Reves, our credit person,  and we are okay with the concept except that we would like for the ratings  trigger to be based only on either a drop in the S&P rating or a failure to  have an S&P rating.
In addition, Brant has advised me that should we put in  place a CSA, that the following would be the credit matrix for collateral  threshold:  BB to BB+  $2,500,000 Below BB  Zero  I look forward to hearing from you.
Should we send you our form of Credit  Support Annex?
