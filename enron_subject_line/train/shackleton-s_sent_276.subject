Attached are the latest documents from the ECT power trading group.
The  documents distributed in March, 1999 were revised recently although no  redline is available.
There are no other forms currently in use.
I'll speak  with Elizabeth Sager about pending revisions.
Also, I will send to you both  my thoughts regarding an action plan for the coming months.
Let me know if  you need anything further and if I should be copying any business  people/legal on our e-mails.
