Rosalee:  Could you please print out the following two documents for Mr.  Lay?
One is an excel sheet showing the summary of the results of our analyis  of the core/noncore market structure that Mr. Lay has been discussing with  leaders in California.
The other is a word document explaining the summary  tables contents.
If you have any questions, just let me know.
Maureen, can  you print out for Steve, too?
Thanks very much for your help.
Best,
