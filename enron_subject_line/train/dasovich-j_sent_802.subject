Chris:    As we discussed yesterday, Laird and I spoke and we think that the  presentation is good to go for Thursday.
We'll need to update the numbers  for the offer we made to S.D.
last week.
You had mentioned that you might  want to include a shaped product.
You still considering it?
Let us know and  we can add it, and make any other changes you'd like to make at this end.
My flight gets into S.D.
at at 8:35 on southwest.
Best,
