I will be out of the office for most of the day on Friday.
My dad is  experiecing serious health problems, and he will be in Houston on Friday for  an appointment with a specialist that I have arranged.
I will be going to  the doctor's appointment with my dad.
Depending upon waiting room time, I  may not be in the office for the 1:30 meeting in EB3305 to discuss the  findings from the recent internal audit projects.
I have asked Shona Wilson  to attend in my place.
Please continue with the meeting, as I know that this  is a difficult meeting to schedule.
I will get an update from Shona when I  get back to the office.
