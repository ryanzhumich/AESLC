Attached is a revised, red-lined version of the extension letter.
I believe that I addressed Keith's question to his satisfaction, so I haven't added the additional language that he suggested regarding the timing of the removal of the existing compressor units at Stations 1, 2 and 3.
Please let me know if you have any additional comments.
Thanks.
