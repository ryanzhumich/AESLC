Robert,  We are diligently trying to increase our United Way participation.
Currently, Net Works is only at 57% participation.
Listed below are  employees in your department who have not gone online to make their pledge.
I'm asking you to personally all each of them today, and encourage them to  make their pledge.
If any names listed below are not with your department,  please notify Liz @ 31935.
Should they have problems getting online, please  give Liz a call.
Thank You,
