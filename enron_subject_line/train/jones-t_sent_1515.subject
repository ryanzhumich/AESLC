In order to prepare a Confidentiality Agreement, I will need the following  information:  1.
The company's full legal name 2.
Whether we want a bilateral or Enron Protected Counterparty form 3.
What is the nature of the protected information (what project or type of  transaction is it for) 4.
The company's address, phone number and fax number 5.
Any timing involved for getting this signed (is there a meeting Monday  morning at 9:00 am, so it's a rush, or just send it out, we're starting to  talk to them)
