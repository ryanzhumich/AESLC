Attached are the results of the Balancing Test evaluation performed on October 25, 2001.
According to may paperwork, I should send the results back to Steve Olin but I cannot contact him therefore, I am contacting you with the results.
I regret to inform you that Enron has unsuccessfully completed Balancing Test evaluation.
Results are attached.
