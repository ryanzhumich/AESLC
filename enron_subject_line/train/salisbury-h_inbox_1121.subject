Jeff Richter will be transitioning off of the Short Term California trading desk and on to the EES Risk Management team during the next several weeks.
Jeff will be taking an important leadership role, joining the management team with Don Black and Rogers Herndon.
Jeff, Don, and Rogers will report jointly to me and Kevin Presto.
While Jeff will be sorely missed in his current role managing the Short Term California desk, his trading and technology skills are sorely needed on the EES side of the business.
Over the next couple of weeks we will sort out the new responosibilities on the Short Term California desk.
