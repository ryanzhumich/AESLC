Chris and Mike,  We are trying to do some sales tax planning, and need to know when the first  LM 6000's will be ready to ship (or store, as the case may be).
I know there  are projected dates in the purchase agreement, but those were more targets  than commitment on the first few units.
Can you give the current status?
Thanks,
