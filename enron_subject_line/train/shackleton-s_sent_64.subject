I spoke with Marsha Greenblatt (Sempra's trading lawyer).
She was unaware of  any issues with Sempra's dealing with ECTRIC but recognized that (i) this is  a credit decision and (ii) trading with ECTRIC has occurred.
Sempra does  have a London trading operation so maybe the London traders for both of our  respective companies have been transacting.
Of course, all confirms she  reviewed were with ECT/Sempra (except for one or two ECTRIC confirms).
Based upon our recent ECT/ECTRIC internal conversation, I don't anticipate  further confusion.
Thanks for everyone's attention to this matter.
