Ina,  I need to be able to pull price curves from the Oracle database.
Can you  please see to it that I get the proper access tomorrow.
This is required for  a special project for Phillip, so it is high priority.
Let me know if you  need any further clarification of what I need, but I think IT should know.
Thank you.
