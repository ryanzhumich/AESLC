I spoke with Kori Loibl, the book administrator for the NG Price Affiliate  Books regarding the status of the Affiliate Basis book last night (not  officialized).
Dutch and I are working with Jeramy Wong in IT support to put  together a program that will let Dutch and myself know the status of every  book that should be officialized at the end of each night, so that these  problems can be fixed before the morning.
The book in question was officialized this morning and has zero (0) value.
Please call me at X5-8274 with any questions,  Errol L. McLaughlin
