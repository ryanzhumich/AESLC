This evening, ECT faxed comments to counterparty's proposed ISDA to both John  Joel and Douglas Marshall.
We also resent the Credit Support Annex because  counterparty never commented on ours and failed to include one.
John Joel  called me this morning to determine when the lawyers could speak.
I told him  to schedule a conference call because ECT was ready and was faxing comments  today.
I haven't heard from him.
