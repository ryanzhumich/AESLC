Here is the draft for distribution.
In addition to the customer-friendly  "looking forward to meeting with our business partners" language I know  you'll include, I'd suggest including something like the following:  Attached are drafts of the proposed tariff provisions (including the form of  Transport Option Amendment) and a filing letter.
We are providing these  draft documents to you in advance of filing them with FERC as part of a  good-faith effort to resolve any remaining issues with our shippers prior to  filing.
The drafts are for purposes of discussion by workshop attendees  only, and we ask that you not distribute them to persons outside your  company.
Additionally, while we hope that these drafts are close to being in  final form, they are of course subject to revision and final management  approval prior to filing with the Commission.
