Today's simulation has been postponed to next Wednesday.
Unfortunately, they  have not yet opened the system to the entire web - you have to be on the  Enron intranet to get access.
If you want to see it badly enough, I might be  able to arrange something for you in our NY office (midtown) otherwise I'll  let you know when they roll it out onto the web.
