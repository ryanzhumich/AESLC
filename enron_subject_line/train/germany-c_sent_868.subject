I believe Kodak just doesn't support the USB connection very well.
I tried  the other connection and it works great.
I pulled all the tractor pictures  off the camera with no problem.
I still have not seen a photo as clear as  the very first one Chance pulled up of the family reunion though.
All the tractor pictures are a little fuzzy.
