Christine and I seem to have gotten Phillips interested in a right to  terminate if TW's minimum tariff rate ever exceeds the contract rate.
They  said they would mull it over, at least.
But what they really would prefer to have is a provision in which they would  get the contract rate no matter what.
Since this would make it a negotiated  rate deal from day 1, I feel like I need to get your buy-in before we agree  to it.
Steve has already told me it is OK with him.
Please advise.
