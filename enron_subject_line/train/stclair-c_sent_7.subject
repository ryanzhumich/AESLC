Willie: Thanks for your voice mail message.
As I explained to Joe and David, on  all of the counterparties where we have "EOL Issues" I need to know what  those issues are and then I will call them.
Could you please advise Joe  and/or David about this and then I will follow up.
The only issue that we  discussed was the issue that these counterparties are thinking that the  clicking requirement in the ETA applies to confirms which it doesn't.
Thanks
