Michael Corbally just wanted me to confirm the following with you.
Per the  list of Datasources you sent me, for France we've got Meteo France listed at  the Paris address.
We had a confirm earlier this year using Meteo France  where we used their Toulouse address.
I just wanted to confirm that the  address we want as the standard address will be the Meteo France out of  Paris, not Toulouse.
If you'll just confirm that for me.
