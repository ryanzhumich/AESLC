Greetings:  See attached "meeting notice."
This could be a good opportunity to get our  demand-side proposal on the table.
Dennis:  If we could get some power point slides together, we could present  our ideas to this group and the leg aides mentioned.
Let me know your  thoughts.
Also attached is a summary of the bill that the CA Assembly passed today.
Please pass this along to others who might be interested.
Thanks.
Jeff
