This is material that I received re: Nord Pool from Davies (one of  Schroeder's guys).
If you want to take a wack at putting together a few  bullets on what Nord Pool is, how it differs from Cal model and why it's  preferable, that would help me immensely and free me up to focus on 1)  comments to Gov's proposal and 2) more detail on demand buy-down.
That  possible?
Let me know.
Greatly appreciated.
Best,
