Ben,  I made a minor adjustment to the LOI re: exclusivity.
Policy states that any time we sign up to exclusivity we are supposed to get  it approved by Mark Metts, Tim Detmering and the CEO of the affected business  unit.
Seems a little silly in this case, but it can't hurt.
(yes, I know we  didn't do it with the turbine stuff)  Kay
