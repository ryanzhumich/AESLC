Debbie has to be downtown for other reason on May 24th.
Could you meet with  her about 4:15pm at my office.
I will schedule a conference room for your  meeting with Debbie.
Perhaps yopu could come around 3:45pm and I could go  over any and all changes that I have on tem prior to your meeting with  Debbie.
