Enron Enron  is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and communications  companies.
The company, which owns approximately $37 billion in energy and  communications assets, produces electricity and natural gas, delivers physical  commodities and financial and risk management services to customers around the  world, and has developed an intelligent network platform to facilitate online  business - EnronOnline.
Enron's Internet address is www.enron.com .

Is this correct?
I thought Enron didn't produce  electricity...or natural gas....just transported it....   Beth
