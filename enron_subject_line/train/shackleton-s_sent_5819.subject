(1)  I cannot speak with Caroline Abramo at 2.
Please call her and explain  that I'm in the midst of  transaction which must close today (it may roll  into Monday).
Tuesday is a safe bet.
Mention that the deal is being pushed  by the 50th floor over here.
(2)  Did you call Stuart?
Just let me know and I'll call him when I get off  this call.
