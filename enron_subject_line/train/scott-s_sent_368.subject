Sugarbooger,  Looks like Continental is our best bet at $620 per ticket, which I'm assuming  reflects the beginning of the official high season in C.R.
American is  slightly lower but you have to go THRU MIAMI!
Ick!
There is a 9:30 a.m. out of Houston on 12/9 and the return trip from San Jose  is at 8:10 a.m. (a 3 p.m. was also available).
They're holding the tickets for us; if we want them, we have to decide before  COB tomorrow.
Muchos besos!
S.
