For once I remembered.
Hope you have a good one and all is going well.
It  was nice to see ya'll at Christmas.
Tell Terry that Mom and Laurie loved the  trunks.
I was quite happy with the A&M cardholder as well so let Jason and  Erin know for me.
Too bad the Aggie lost that wild one in Shreveport (could  you believe that snow).
Conrats again on your appointment to the board of  the KofC.
Hope 2001 is a superb year for you.
