I am planning a trip to BA from Feb. 27 - March 3.
The objective will be to  present derivatives training for the BA traders, meet with tax and legal  representatives and the Argentine Derivatives Association with respect to  changing tax laws, legislation, and "local" derivatives trading, and sitting  down with Mike Guerriero to establish an "action plan".
The monthly swap  calendar does not indicate other lawyers out of the office during that week.
Please note this on the group calendar.
Thanks.
Sara  P.S.
Mark - let me know if there are other issues you would like to have  addressed.
