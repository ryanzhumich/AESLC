I have a phone number on a post it note on my cabinet, just to the right of  where my computer would be if I was there.
It is a lawyers name (which of  course I can't remember), male, with a 212 or 202 phone number.
It may be  David something or other.
Could you email me that name and number?
Do you know if there is a way for me to save my emails that I have in folders?
Bet the weather is better than this in San Fran.
