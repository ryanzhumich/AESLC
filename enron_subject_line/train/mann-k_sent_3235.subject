Ben/Chris,  Unless something new comes up, I think we finished the letter agreement.
I'm  awaiting a revised draft now, and if it is acceptable to NW, they will sign  it and fax it to me tomorrow morning.
Maybe on Ben's layover we can have a discussion about where we go from here  from a schedule standpoint.
Talk to you tomorrow,  Kay
