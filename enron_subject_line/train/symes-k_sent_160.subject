I'm sorry if I confused you with my e-mail last night, but I think I might  finally have the futures figured out.
Now, instead of one deal number with no  counterparty name, we now have two deal numbers, two counterparties, and the  correct number of MW in each.
Imagine that!
Here is the updated information:  467455 10 MW 175.00 Palo Verde Southern Company Energy Marketing Mark Watson  469098 50 MW 175.00 Palo Verde Sempra Energy Trading Chris Bennett  I hope this makes more sense; please let me know if there's anything else I  can do.
Thanks,
