Dave,  I am sending you my accomplishments for the last year.
I am including also one document (just browse through it quickly) to give you a flavor of some projects I have been working on.
I shall send you shortly an additional document I would like you to browse  through (the list of projects my group works on in a typical week) to give you more  information about the scope and depth of what we do.
It's an internal document and I want  to clean  it up  Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to  you and  your family.
Vince
