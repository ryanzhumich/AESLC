Janelle, I was hoping that maybe we could find a half hour to discuss your  thoughts on your current role.
I have heard you are considering global fuels  and Lagrasta's business.
I would like to give you my perspective on the  future vision for power and the overall organization including gas  mid-market.
Ultimately, ENA and Enron have a very open labour market and you need to  manage your career in a manner that you feel will benefit Enron and yourself  the greatest; however, I think the power market, even though not easy, is the  primary growth engine for Enron Corp over the next several years.
Kay, can you please set up a time at Janelle's convenience.
Regards
