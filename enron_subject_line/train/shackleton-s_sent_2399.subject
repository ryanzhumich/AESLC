Tanya:  SITA now insists on having the Termination Currency and the Contractual  Currency, except as otherwise agreed in any Transaction/Confirmation, as the  Euro.
They will not agree to USD.
[By the way, SITA's lawyers had already  agreed to USD]  Effectively, if we agree to this, the trader will need to  confirm each deal in USD (Contractual Currency) but if we early terminate,  the currency will be Euro's (Termination Currency).
What do you want to do?
Other than the Enron Corp. guaranty, we are finished.
