I wanted to take a minute to thank all of you for your encouragement and donations for my MS150 bike tour this last weekend.
It was so much fun!
There is no doubt that you're money will be of great help as I stock up with pain killers...just kidding.
I will be coming around this week to collect the money so that I can send it as soon as possible to those people diagnosed with MS.
If you're writing a check please make it payable to "National Multicple Sclerosis Society."
Once again, thanks for all of your support!
