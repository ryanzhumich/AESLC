Nelson,  I have booked the TDC deal for the remainder of the term.
It is now in the Gulf3 book at Tenn/Zone1.
If locations need to change, and I'm sure they will, please let me know and I will make sure it is hedged correctly.
sitara #778201  also,  if you could use the same sitara number every month for the central gas it would help make our reconciliation process much smoother.
Thanks,
