Hey buddy, this is out of a Duke Energy newsletter.
I'll just give you the  highlights.
Duke Energy acquired Market Hub Partners Storage (MHP) from subsidiaries of  NiSource, INC.  MHP currently operates 2 facilities.
The Moss Bluff facility  in Liberty County, Texas, and the Egan facility in Acadia Parish, La.
I have never used Moss Bluff, I know it interconnects with Tetco in Stx.
I  like Egan - it hooks up with ANR, Tex Gas, Tenn, CGLF, and Trunkline.
