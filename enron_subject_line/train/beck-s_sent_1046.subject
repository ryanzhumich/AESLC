Patti delivered to Sharron's desk this week a copy of my 2000  accomplishments.
You should find that when you return to the office.
Let  me know if for some reason you do not have that copy, and I will have another  delivered.
Have a happy new year!
I will be at the Cotton Bowl watching Meagan's drill  team perform - and also watching some of the game.
Thankfully, no emotional  attachment to either team in that game!
I just hope that we don't freeze.
