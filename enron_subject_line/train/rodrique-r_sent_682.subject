Virendra,  Let me know when you are available to discuss the Gas Daily GRMS logic.
It  is my understanding that GRMS currently will only include those gas daily  deals that are intramonth deals with an effective date greater than the  current date.
However, we should also include any deals in out months that  are fixed price gas daily deals.
Thanks,
