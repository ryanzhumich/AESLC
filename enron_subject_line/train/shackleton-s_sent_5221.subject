Ken:  Please let me hear from you as soon as possible today.
I will not be in the  office on Friday, Dec. 29.
In connection with the blacklined confirmation which we discussed yesterday,  please   (1)  verify that there are no changes (or if there are changes, we need to  discuss)  (2)  provide Bear's information for Paragraph 8 (Offices)  (3)  advise if you wish for us to finalize the document or if you would  prefer to do so  We would like to exchange faxed signatures today, if at all possible.
Thanks.
Sara
