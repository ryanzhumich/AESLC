Here is the latest draft of the filing for transport options.
Significant  changes include:  - added definition of Counterparty - added captions and reorganized the filing to more clearly reflect  compliance with 154.202 - included an explanation of how the option fee will be part of a negotiated  rate - added an example of how options will work  I think we need to decide whether we are better off with the type of option  fee explanation I have in this draft, or whether we should instead state the  fee will be market based, and include an explanation that, pursuant to the  Commission's discussion in Order 637, market based rates are appropriate  because we are going to commit to an open season process that will be  nondiscriminatory and that will ensure we aren't withholding capacity from  the market.
Can we have a conference call to discuss your comments this week?
I will  have Janet call to determine your availability.
