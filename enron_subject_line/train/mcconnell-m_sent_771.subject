Please distribute the following message to Enron - Worldwide and please use  the Office of the Chairman - Enron Net Works letterhead.
Mike McConnell has  requested that this message be returned for final review and then sent to  Enron - Worldwide this evening.
Please call me at X-36898 if you have any  questions.
Thank you.
Cathy Phillips   Effective immediately, reporting responsibility for Global Strategic Sourcing  (GSS) will move from Enron Net Works to Enron Corp.  George Wasaff, managing  director, will report directly to Rick Causey, executive vice president and  chief accounting officer for Enron.
GSS, formed February 1, 2000, will  continue to focus on supply-chain management world-wide for Enron.
We  believe this change in reporting will leverage and enhance GSS's global reach  and effectiveness while allowing ENW to focus on its core mission of creating  new electronic market places.
