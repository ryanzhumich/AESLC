Guys, I have explained the strategy/tactics that have lead to this position  in some detail.
In my opinion the company is not at risk and potentially ENA  could create significant value from a project that we have very little  invested.
I understand the construction risk on the bid as much as anyone  and we have no intention of lifting their offer.
As far as EECC involvement,  as I had mentioned, Coleman was a part of all these discussions.
I will  argue that Mike and the ENA deal team made the right call necessary to  maximize return in the short run for Enron without investing significant  dollars or taking significant risks.
Obviously, I was unsuccessful in explaining such a sophisticated strategy.
