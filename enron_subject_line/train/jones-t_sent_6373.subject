At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed forms of Broker  Electronic Transaction Agreement and Fee Agreement.
I understand from Bob  Shults that we still need to define who the legal contracting party will be  for APB Energy-Europe.
After you have had a chance to review the agreements,  please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or me at (713)  853-3399 with any questions or comments you might have.
We look forward to  hearing from you.
