Greetings,  I'm working with Sheila Tweed and others at ENA and EECC in developing a more  standardized contract with GE for equipment purchases.
The goal is to  develop a more efficient contracting process, and to avoid negotiating the  same  points repeatedly, with varying results among business units.
Sheila  has suggested that I drop you a line to see if this is something you might  find interesting and/or helpful.
You now have my email address, and my phone number is 713 345 7566.
Please  let me know your thoughts about participating in the process.
Thank you,
