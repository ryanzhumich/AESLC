Q2 earnings report looks very good!
Congratulations.
I will keep it quiet  until you are sure of the numbers.
We should let Causey and Hayslett know for  planning purposes ASAP.
Given the recent events related to the proposed sale do you think it is even  worth discussing the Benefits issue with Corporate?
Also, have we finalized all of the divestiture/retention deals?
Have a good week.
Thanks.
