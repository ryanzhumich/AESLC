Dave,  Attached is the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement.
The document you  faxed me was the preprinted form of ISDA Master Agreement.
That document,  TOGETHER with the attached Schedule is your full "ISDA Master Agreement".
Also attached to this Schedule is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty and  proposed form of Legal Opinion to be issued by Clark County PUD #1.
It is my understanding that you will provide these documents directly to the  counterparty.
Again, the whole package above must be provided to the  counterparty or you will not have a complete set of documents.
Call me if  you have any questions.
