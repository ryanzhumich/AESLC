Thanks for remembering me (even though I FORGOT to send you birthday wishes  last month).
It doesn't seem like a year, does it?
Hope you're doing great  and your family is well.
How's the HOUSE OF THE CENTURY coming along?
I  recall looking at the plans just "yesterday".
Stay well (and young).
Sara
