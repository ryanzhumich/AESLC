Sorry , I have not given you feedback earlier but I've been on vacation.
Randy continues to do an excellent job.
He anticipates questions and usually  has the answers.
He is a very dedicated employee and continues to expand on  his knowledge base.
He has helped the traders trade the permian and waha  points on a daily basis and such commercial experience has proven to be very  valuable regarding looking for alternatives to move gas.
The only area for  improvement that I might suggest would be to challenge others or state his  opinion if he has a different opinion from others rather than not say  anything or go along with the status quo.
He tends to want to be  nonconfrontational which is not a bad thing but this is a tough environment  and he could get run over if he does not state his opinion.
