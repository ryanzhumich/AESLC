Attached is the UK form of ISDA Schedule which should have the UK choice of  law and arbitration language in it.
I send it with a caveat that this draft  is 2 years old.
The London lawyers were gone by the time I got your call, so  I couldn't check to see if they have revised this, so by copy of this to Matt  Dawson, I am asking him to confirm that there is no substantive change in the  choice of law or arbitration language.
