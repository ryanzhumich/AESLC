Chris:  Please call.
The parties need to exchange documents and the boilerplate  (which we are unable to send) requires execution.
If you must trade today,  we could exchange fax signatures and your counterparty can fax evidence of  authority to enter into the master and transactions.
In any event, we need to execute duplicate originals, one for each party.
