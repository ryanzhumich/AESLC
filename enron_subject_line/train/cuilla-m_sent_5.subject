Cheryl, I was in your store on 9/23/00 and saw some Bernhardt furniture I am  interested in.
It is the Paris Collection Dining Table and Chairs and the  numbers are:  346-242  Table 346-244  Base 346-502  Air Chair (4) 346-501  Side Chair  Also I am interested in one of the two beds in the Paris Collection:  346-435  Sleigh Bed 5-0  346-527  Metal Canopy 5-0 346-457  Poster Bed 5-0 346-416  Poster Headboard 4-6 thru 5-0  On the second bed I am not sure if you need all three pieces or not so it  would help if you could tell me what is the difference between the three  pieces.
Finally, I am interested in an amroire and chest of draws (there are  several depending if I go with a granite top or not): 346-144  Armoire 346-237  Right Stone Top 346-236  Right Bachelor's Chest Base 346-235  Right Bachelor'e Chest 346-042  Dressing Chest 346-044  Dressing Chest Stone Top 346-043  Dressing Chest Base
