Hello Kenny,  Just a couple of things.
One our stock is up again today  now it is up 2 at  62$  I was wondering if we should sell some?
What is your opinion.
Also I have some reading for you tonight - The Skiliing Story is all over the  Gas Market.
(I told Ya).
I know that Clayton has soccer tonight - dont  worry about dinner , I would actually prefer some of that Turkey tonight.
I love you
