Mark and Paul:  Have either of you ever reviewed clearinghouse rules with  respect to clearing members for the exhanges on which we trade (in an effort  to analyze our risk with respect to our brokers)?
If the answer is yes,  could I have copies of any memoranda?
Please let me hear from you or  whomever may have reviewed this issue.
Thank you.
Sara
