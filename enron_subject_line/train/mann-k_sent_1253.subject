Charlotte,  Michael hasn't bounced back yet - still getting fever up to 102.
I spoke  with Delores, and she said Rey said that Michael had a pretty good dose of  strep, so it will take 6 doses of medicine to get it under control.
I'll see  how he is in the early am, but I may not take him to school, just so I can  watch him another few hours.
If you will be at your office tomorrow I'll let  you know how he's doing.
Maybe I can leave on Saturday.
I know he will be  very upset if he doesn't get to spend time with you this weekend.
