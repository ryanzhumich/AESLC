Louise,  I hope you had a pleasant weekend in N.O.
If you have a few minutes to  spare, I'd like to get together with you this afternoon  to talk about the  weather deal documentation.
As I tried to draft up the standard GTC's I  realized there are more variables in these transactions than are currently  listed in the short & long description lists.
