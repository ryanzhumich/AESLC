Greg,  Attached is a draft of interconnect agreement form based on the  discussion we had yesterday.
I left the reimbursement provision open with  only placeholder language that indicated they will be paying for the  interconnect in some form.
I made some assumptions about equipment that  either party would install, however this can easily be changed.
I didn't draft any credit language in the agreement.
I think this would be  best handle by simply having our credit department review these guys and if  they are worried about them, we should require them to make an upfront  payment before we buy or build anything.
Take a look at the draft and let me  know if you have any questions.
