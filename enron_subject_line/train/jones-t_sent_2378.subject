We have a really old agreement with the referenced counterparty and I don't  think we use it to trade under anymore.
I spoke to the Confirm Desk and it  appears all of our trading is under Dynegy Marketing and Trade.
If you  concur, I would like to inactive that master, since I'm afraid it might get  attached for online trading.
