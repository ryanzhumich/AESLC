We have received the amendment to the BC Gas ISDA Master executed by BC Gas,  which adds the Canadian Securities Representation, so we don't have to add  the rep into every confirm.
BC Gas won't sign the confirms with the rep in,  and this has caused much difficulties.
I am going to count it as signed,  since BC Gas has signed, but we still need it to be signed by ECC.
Can you  get it signed ASAP and back to me.
Much thanks.
