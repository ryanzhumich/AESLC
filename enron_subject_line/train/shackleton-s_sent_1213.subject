Bob:  I left you a voice mail last week about a lunch that legal would like  to present next month for both groups (above).
We need a list of settlements  persons who should be invited.
The purpose of the meeting is to provide an  overview of the legal documentation process, including explanations of our  documents, and encourage dialogue among the groups.
Please send as soon as  possible.
Also, let me know if you have any particular topics which you  would like to see addressed.
Thanks.
Sara
