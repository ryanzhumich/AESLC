Andrea,  The two gentlemen that I mentioned on my voice mail are Kevin Murray and  Leonidas Savas.
Both are from LSU and start this summer as Associates.
Both have expressed their strong desire to  have their first rotation in Trading and I think they would  do a great job for us.
If you concur, please make a note to place them in  Trading for their first rotation .
I have attached both resumes for your  reference.
thanks,
