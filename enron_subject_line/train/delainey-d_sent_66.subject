Ken, in response to the letter from Mr Miguel San Juan, my suggestion would  be to offer up the Falcon for their use; however, given the tight time frame  and your recent visit with Mr. Fox that it would be difficult for either you  or me to participate.
I spoke to Max and he agrees with this approach.
I hope this meets with your approval.
