Janie  As we discussed, we would like you to consider adding the OXY point for Elk Hills deliveries into SOCAL at the Gosford intertie to the "NGI Socal/PG&E KRS" physical point.
If you look on SOCAL's System Operations report our deliveries are listed as "Elk Hills - Gosford Intertie".
Our flows on this pipeline typically range from 80MM to 165MM/day.
Our gas from  this point interconnects with the PG&E Kern River station gas that then is delivered through Wheeler Ridge into SOCAL.
Separately we would also be very interested in an SOCAL In state Production point on Enron OnLine.
