Peter,   I can't recall if I've sent you this override letter before.
Essentially, it  is a letter which is in effect for as long as the equipment is owned by  E-Next Generation, but which ceases to be effective once the equipment is  assigned to a third party.
We will need something along the same line for  the ABB equipment.
If you can send me a redline of the final form of the  ABB  facility agreement against the master, we can discuss how to proceed.
Thanks,
