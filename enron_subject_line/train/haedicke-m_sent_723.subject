I propose that we continue to alternate the Office of General Counsel ("OGC")  and Legal Committee ("LC") meetings of Enron Wholesale Services on Monday  mornings at 8:30 am, Houston time.
The OGC and the LC would have the  following members:           OGC     LC  Alan Aronowitz     OGC  Mark Evans     Justin Boyd  Barbara Gray     Michelle Cash  Jeff Hodge     Steven Douglas  Bruce Lundstrom    Peter Keohane  Travis McCullough    John Novak  Julia Murray     [Marcus Von Bock und Polach?]
Elizabeth Sager     Dan Rogers  Richard Sanders    Paul Simons  Lance Schuler  Mark Taylor  Sheila Tweed  Randy Young   Please give me your comments.
It is anticipated that we will continue to  adjust the membership of both groups as the businesses continue to change.
I  plan to address the policy committee in February.
