Christian: I sent out the Schedules to Jeff Brown by e-mail and faxed him and Laird the  preprinted ISDA and CSA.
Ed Sacks seems to think that they are a German  company.
I have asked then for more information.
Laird is hot to get this  "signed up" on Monday.
I am out on Monday but if necessary, Sara or Mary  Cook can help you.
Marie Heard is the legal assistant.
I will be checking  my voice mail messages but will be out of pocket from Noon-5 on Monday.
