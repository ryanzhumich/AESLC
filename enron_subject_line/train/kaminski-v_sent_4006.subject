Greg,  As you may know, Brad Romine's dot.com venture fell apart.
The offer from Enron looks much better now.
I have arranged for him a number of different interviews (including one with you).
I think we should  not be too punitive and give him the 2nd chance.
I am also setting up for him interviews  with RAC and EBS  and he should be able to negotiate a good first rotation.
Please, give me a call if you have any other question.
