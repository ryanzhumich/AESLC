Susan: Has this Master been executed?
I forgot what we specified as the effective  date of the Transfer and Assignment Agreement with ARMS but we need to make  absolutely sure that the effective date covers all trades that are done by  ARMS and that there is no gap between that effective date and the effective  date of our Master.
Also, please make sure that Tana knows when the  Utilicorp Master becomes effective so she can notify the online folks.
Thanks.
