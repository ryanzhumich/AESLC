Dave,  I would like to recommend to you Sandeep Kohli who is likely to approach you  regarding a position in your area.
I have  been working with Sandeep for a number of years and I was always  impressed with his skills, intelligence and mature, thoughtful approach to solving business  problems.
He is currently located in India (our DPC unit) and is looking for a  permanent position with Enron in Houston for family reasons (his wife is from Houston and has a family here).
Of  course, there are some  other obvious factors affecting his decision.
Vince
