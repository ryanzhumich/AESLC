Attached is the proposed contract with Oneok.
Since it is a maximum rate  deal, there is no discount letter.
However, I am circulating this for  approval because it contains a special provision (found in the "Other"  section) regarding marketing of capacity for release, as allowed by Section  30.8 of the General Terms and Conditions of Transwestern's tariff.
Christine, you and Michele will need to fill in the address and account  information.
My sincerest apologies for operating outside the usual  contracting procedure but since time is even more of the essence that usual  here, I felt it was best to get a pro forma version of this out for approval  as soon as possible.
Please e-mail your approval to Christine and me by noon tomorrow if  possible.
Thank you.
