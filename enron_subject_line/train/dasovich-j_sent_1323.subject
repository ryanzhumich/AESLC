Jennifer:  I got a call from Chris Bailey (sp?)
needing a summary of  California dereg for a presentation(s) that Harold's assembling.
Attached is  summary that Mona pulled together for Harold a couple of months ago.
I don't  have Chris' email address (I've left him a message).
Could you forward this  along to him?
Thanks a bunch.
Best,
