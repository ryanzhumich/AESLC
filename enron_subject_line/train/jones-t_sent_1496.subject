Hydro Quebec has forwarded to us their form of ISDA Schedule for the  referenced counterparty for review.
There is no indication of what Enron  business person is interested in this counterparty.
I will forward a copy of  the ISDA to Mr. "Canada" Suttle, and open a Lotus Notes entry with the  contact information.
We won't do anything until we receive a credit  worksheet from Credit.
