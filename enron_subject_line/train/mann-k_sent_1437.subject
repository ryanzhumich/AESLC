We had a very good work session with GE today to iron out the details of the  break out contract.
We expect to have a draft on Monday, which should be  close to final as far as the form goes.
I have also asked A & K to prepare a  memo outlining what will need to be done on a project basis to complete the  document.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
