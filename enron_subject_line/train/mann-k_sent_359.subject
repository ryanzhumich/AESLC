I have some folks who want to option some land in New York.
Do we have a  company for New York yet?
If not, I seem to recall that we were going to  start using one of the existing companies for land options instead of  creating a new one every time.
Am I remembering that correctly?
Basically I'm looking for the company name to use in an option.
Any  suggestions?
Thanks,
