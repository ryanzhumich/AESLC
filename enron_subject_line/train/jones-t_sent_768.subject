Attached please find the referenced lists.
Please note the following:  1.
For Puget Sound, no change in our earlier approvals except for power.
For power, open for West products, but ENRON SALES only for East products.
2.
For Ferrell International Limited, Credit shows them as an amended CP,  but I have no record of seeing them before, so I treated them as a new CP.
Again, no European power for U.S. counterparties.
