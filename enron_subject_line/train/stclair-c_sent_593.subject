Sara and Jason: Here are my initial thoughts on how we can possibly shorten the weather  confirms that are done under a Master Agreement.
It seems like we could  amend the Masters to include the following definitions which seem to be used  in each conform:  Payment Date NCDC NWS HDD CDD The Fallback Reference Weather Station procedures - the confirm would  identify just the Fallback Reference Weather Station Data Sources  Let me know what you think.
Carol  Alos, is it necessary to specify bank account information if that is already  set forth in the Master?
