Dave: I hope all is going well.
I left you an e-mail regarding coming over to work for you.
I decided to not except the UBS deal, so I wanted to come work for you and Janet.
Since I have already talked with these guys, I am pretty much available today going forward.
Again, you know what I have done and I think it would be a good fit.
Hope to hear from you soon.
Regards,
