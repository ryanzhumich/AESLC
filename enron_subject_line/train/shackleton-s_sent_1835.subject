Sam:  Please get on my calendar for Friday.
We need to update agreements,  status, etc.
Also, we need to add a "Futures Agreement" designation to Lotus  Notes.
Please bring your latest printouts for existing agreements and  provide a copy for me.
Let's take about an hour.
Thanks.
Sara  ps  Also, if you have any questions about masters, etc., bring them along!
