Barbara/Jeff:  In the  TurboPark world there will be certain impacts on how power projects  involving physical capacity are structured and implemented.
I know some (but  not all) of it.
I can say that it is fairly easy to bust the structure and  wind up with assets on the balance sheet, and that the commercial folks  aren't always (or even usually) sensitive to the issues.
Maybe after the  first of the year those group members who will be working on the power  origination and development side could get briefed by the finance and  accounting folks.
