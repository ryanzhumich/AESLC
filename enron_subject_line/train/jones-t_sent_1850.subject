Per my conversations with Mark Taylor, we should continue to put any weather  trades done online under any relevant master agreement with the  counterparty.
Further, there is no prohibition against doing a trade online  with a counterparty when we do not have a master in place.
Any non-master  trades would go under the respective GTC.
It appears to be only a  coincidence that we are trading online only with counterparties we have  masters in place with.
