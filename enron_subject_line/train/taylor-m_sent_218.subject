Scott:  I have a call scheduled with Martin for tomorrow morning to discuss these  CFTC  issues.
I'll let you know how it goes.
I have also not forgotten your request for my view on Martin's tenure in  Houston.
I have mixed feelings that are difficult to put down in writing and  I'm hoping we can take a few minutes in New Orleans to discuss.
Mark
