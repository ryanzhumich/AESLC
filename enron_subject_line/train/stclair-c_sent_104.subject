Mary: Enclosed is a draft of the CA agreement.
I spoke with DSavid this morning  about the point that you had raised as item #3 in your last e-mail and given  what Enron has done and might in the future do in this area, from a legal  standpoint, I cannot get comfortable placing any further limitations on Enron  in this agreement other than the disclosure and use limitations that are  currently in the CA which we feel should protect RMS.
Ones interpretation of  what is meant by "creating derivative works of" the data is to ambiguous for  me to feel comfortable putting ahytning further in this CA.
I look forward  to hearing from you.
Carol
