I spoke to the fellow at legalanywhere.com today.
He will only be in the  office Mon.
and Tues. of next week, so if possible, he would like to set up a  demonstration with us together at your desk on the computer so he can work us  through the software.
Let me know when a convenient time would be for you,  maybe Tuesday sometime?
