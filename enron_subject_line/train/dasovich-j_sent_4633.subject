Hi Maureen:  Steve should have received via fax from Scott Govenar a letter to Hertzberg  and Burton from the Republican leadership in the CA Legislature.
The letter  1) conveys a strong willingness on the part of the Republicans to work  together to solve the problem and 2) provides an outline of the key  components of a comprehensive solution.
Could you please get a copy of the  letter to Rosalee; and Rosalee could you get a copy of the letter to Ken  Lay?
Thanks very much for your help.
Best,
