Leslie Hansen just called me and it appears the power traders have asked her  to review the ETA for trading on the Dynegy Website.
I told her we were  meeting to develop a policy about the opening of such websites, that we had  no board resolutions passed allowing the opening of them, nor do we have  control procedures in place about where statements go, etc., so we can  control and prevent "rogue" trading.
She said before she sent this out she  would contact you.
