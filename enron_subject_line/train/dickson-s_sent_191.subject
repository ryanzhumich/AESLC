Gregg,   As we discussed...
I would add the following provision at the end of the  second sentence in Section VIII A.
(3):  ;provided however, in the event that Seller's invoice to Buyer is delayed due  to Buyer not providing Seller the ANR information in the time period  specified in Section V (2), the due date for payment of the Demand Charge  shall be the twenty fifth (25th) day following the service month.
