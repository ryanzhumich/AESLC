Greetings:  Are we supposed to do the reading and the Oracle and Legal Services cases for  Thursday?
Syllabus says yes, but I gather from Tasker's Izio not that we'll  be in the computer center all class doing modeling.
(I'd email her, but she  doesn't get my emails apparently.)
Anyone have a clue?
Best,
