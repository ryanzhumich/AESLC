Here are the issues I see with their draft:  Does not allow for us to sell them power, only buy their power and sell to  others.
This means that we can't sell them power until we get the full  contract in place.
Fuel transactions include fuel oil, and I thought we weren't managing fuel  oil.
Incentive fee (in main contract) defined to only include the sale of gas.
Doesn't include the language we need for internal approvals.
Payment section doesn't address payment for sale of power to them from the  market.
