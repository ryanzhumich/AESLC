Congratulations to everyone on making it through Q3 more or less intact and a big thank-you to those who pulled us through with all your hard work.
Given the continued increase in the number and variety of transactions coming to us from the Global Finance and VPP teams, we are going to have to revise our staffing procedures and ask each of the lawyers in the group to take on some of this burden.
If any of you receive a request to handle one of these deals, please refer the requester to me or at least let me know so that we can equitably distribute the load.
Mary and Anne will be scheduling training sessions for the entire group during which they will go over some of the most common structures and the issues that they have faced recently to help us on our way.
As with all of our work, I expect that we will each be available to the others in the group to bounce ideas around and help with thorny issues.
