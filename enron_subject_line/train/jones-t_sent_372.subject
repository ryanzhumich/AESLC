Per Mark's approval, when we entered into the master with CGAS, we found out  they never entered into a resolution approving the swap agreement or trades  thereunder.
So each and everytime we do a trade with them we are going to  have to get a resolution authorizing entering into the trade.
So for the executed master swap agreement list we need to put:  "Need board  resolution prior to trading"
