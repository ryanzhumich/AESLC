I am hosting drinks at my home and dinner at Champions Golf Club on Saturday,  May 5 for my operations team and their spouses.
Greg and I talked about this  today.
He asked me to e-mail you so that you could put this on his calendar  and said that you would e-mail his wife to check the date as well.
If he and  his wife are available, I will let you know details as it gets closer.
Thanks for your help.
