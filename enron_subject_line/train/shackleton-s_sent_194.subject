Let's eliminate future problems with Dow and their trader Mike Billings.
Credit has given the O.K.
to trade in the name of The Dow Chemical Company.
We will document trades on the "omnibus" UNLESS we are able to negotiate an  ISDA with the counterparty.
Tell Mike Billings that we will not keep changing from "Dow Hydrocarbons and  Resources, Inc." to the parent company.
We waste too much time and energy.
Call if you have questions.
