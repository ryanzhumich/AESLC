David: Could you please confirm the following for me:  1.
With ACE USA, Inc., we confirm using the "deemed ISDA" format.
For some  reason they were on our Annex A list.
Do you know why?
2.
We only do physical deals with Northern Indiana Public Service Company and  the "Columbia Gas" entities.
Again, they too were on our Annex A list.
Thanks.
