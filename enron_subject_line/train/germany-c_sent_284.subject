I went motorcycle riding last night - I think I need to get some better  winter riding gear.
We will definitely go to court next Tuesday at 1:00 PM.
All we are doing is  verifying Dad's signature on the will.
Once the judge sees us it should only  take about five minutes.
That's all I have for now.
