Kim-  Listed below are the issues, pretty much as written, in the meeting on the West Texas Leg.
Some are self-explanatory while others are somewhat cryptic.
I will follow up with a list that better defines each issue, and you might have your guys think about each as well.
We'll get back together soon (I'm not sure I can do it this week), and discuss an action plan.
-	CS 9 fuel -	Atoka Lateral 	We have both supply and market opportunities within the lateral itself -	Turbocharge the Atoka #3 units -	Look at Zia pressure obligation on the contract -	Agave replacement gas at Atoka #3 -	Complete the loop between WT-1 and WT-2 -	Coolers to WT-2 -	Pecos compressor re-wheel and engine upgrade -	200 	300 (WT-2 to Pecos) flow study -	Look at Block Valve 16 bi-directional interconnect w/Sid Richardson, and ability flow incremental above 340 on the total system -	Look at Keystone into NNG; back to TW south of WT-2 -	Check pressure of Stations 6 & 7, and PNM receipts -	MAOP restriction on Panhandle leg due to encroachment  Let's talk.
Thanks,
