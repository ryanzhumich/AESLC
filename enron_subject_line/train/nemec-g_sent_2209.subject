Nick,  Attached is the form of services agreement.
The form is a little  different than Steve Van Hooser's original form.
This a form that we used in  Wyoming which I modified to fit this context.
I will prepare the tasking  letter based on your scope of work and forward shortly.
Let me know if you  have any questions.
