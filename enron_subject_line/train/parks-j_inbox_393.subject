<<Redline_.rtf>>  Here is the revised draft.
I spoke with the Duke attorney and he is taking "let me see it and I'll let you know" approach so let me know if you have any additional changes and I will send it over to him.
Also, it is my understanding that we must now have a Weil Gotschal bankruptcy attorney sign off on the deal so I am trying to find out who that person is and what needs to be done.
