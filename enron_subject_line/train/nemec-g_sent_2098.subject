Ken,  Attached is a draft of my comments to the gathering agreement.
I have  made it clear in the language that the agreement is fully interruptible at  our discretion.
The agreement is still a keep whole on the liquids.
I did  not change this section.
Also I did not review or change Exhibit A.  I will  leave that to you.
