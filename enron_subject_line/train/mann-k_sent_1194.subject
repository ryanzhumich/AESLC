To all,  As you know, Enron is refinancing the equipment we bought through WestLB.
I've been asked to compile a list of all the equipment purchased through  WestLB, and the change orders related to same.
All I know about is the LM  deal with GE (with 1 executed change order, approximately 4 or 5 pending) and  the ABB transformer deal (with one CO pending).
Please let me know if you  are aware of any others.
Thanks,
