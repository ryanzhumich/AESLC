Attached is the referenced list.
There are only 2 counterparties for  approval on this list, and I have problems with each of them.
Virginia Electric and Power Company is coming through as an amendment to add  financial power.
I still cannot open them up until we resolve directly with  the company what issue, if any, there appears to be doing financial products  with utilities under Virginia law.
Notes in our database reflect that this  was an issue and they were creating a marketing sub to do the business.
I  have a call into Credit to find out who their contact is, we will have to  resolve this directly with them.
Again, TXU Lone Star Pipeline is coming through as a division of TXU Gas  Company, and that needs to be made part of the name.
