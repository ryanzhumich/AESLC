That power shortage Friday cut us off in the middle of our conversation about  the appropriate tax language to use for a confirmation evidencing a trade  between Teeside Power Financing Limited and RMT.
I have attached the  proposed form of confirmation.
I have combined in it the usual tax language  we have in RMT confirmations along with the language we use in a cross-border  trade between a Delaware corporation (usually ECT, now RMT) and company  (Teeside Power) located in a treaty country acting exclusively through  non-U.S. branches (England).
Please let me know if the tax language meets  with your approval.
