Michele:  Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol:  1.
In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to  that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I  believe an additional 10-12 days).
2.
After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence  until December 31, 2000.
Please let me know if there is anything else you need.
Mark
