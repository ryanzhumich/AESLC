I have reviewed the above proposed confidentiality agreement and have made  certain modifications which are in line with the confidentiality agreement  presently in effect between ENA and Markwest.
Since the new agreement is to  cover Markwest for the period that they are letting Enron review Markwest's  financials which are scheduled to be publicly released next week, the term  references therein need to only cover the period from the date hereof until  such financials are scheduled to be released, which I understand to be next  week.
The change to Enron Corp was made because the employees who will  receive the information are now employees of Enron Corp.
Please have your  attorney contact me if there are any problems with the manner or substance of  the changes noted in the document.
