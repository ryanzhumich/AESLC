Hoyt,  Under the Older Workers Benefits Protection Act, we must provide demographic  information to persons over the age of 40 who are offered severance packages  in exchange for a release.
We need the title/position and the age of the  persons holding those positions for the persons who were offered a package as  well as the persons who were not offered a package.
We will provide this  data to persons over 40 to validate their releases.
Thanks.
