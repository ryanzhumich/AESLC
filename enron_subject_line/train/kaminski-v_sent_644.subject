Molly,  Please, make arrangements for the interview with this candidate for a  trading position.
Interviews with John Lavorato, Jeff Shankman, Gary Hickerson, Stinson Gibner.
I talked to him in New York and he is considering other opportunities, so we have to act fast.
I think John will like him more than Punit.
Thanks
