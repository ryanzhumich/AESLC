I haven't seen any of the press reports (even though I am in London and I  hear that's where they were) but I thought this was a well drafted response.
The only additional rumours I have heard indicate that the police may have  been rough in their handling of demonstrators outside the fence at the plant  construction site.
I remember hearing that there were times that the  construction workers feared for their lives because of the vehemence of the  protesters.
I guess that didn't make it into the Human Rights Watch (ever  heard of them?)
report.
