This will summarize our conversation this morning in which you asked if there  was a problem with your purchase of an equity investment (through a private  placement) in an internet/communications company.
My response was that Enron  prohibits the trading by employees of (i) any security on the Restricted List  maintained by the Compliance Group, (ii) any security, instrument or  commodity within that employees area of responsibility and (iii) any energy  commodity.
I suggested that you contact Donna Lowry to confirm both my  understanding and that the security in question is not on teh Restricted List.
While I did not mention it on the phone, I should point out that it would be  unwise to take a position in a competitor of Enron's that would (or might in  the future) give you control or the appearance of control or influence over  the management of that competitor.
