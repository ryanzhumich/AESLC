Mark,  In response to your voicemail this morning, this is EGAS 4th Qtr per the 2nd CE.
It has been adjusted to pull out the items that have been transferred out of EGAS since the 2nd CE  ( Azurix International and South America Merchant ) and the transfer in of European Assets and the Middle East.
This does NOT include EPower which I understand will be transferred from Europe to EGAS in the 4th Qtr.
We are currently working on our 3rd CE and will send you those numbers when we are done.
