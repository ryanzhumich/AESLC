Gerald,   I understand that you will be taking on some of Sandi's projects since she left the company.
I have been working with Sandi on an agency agreemtent between ENA and Tenaska IV Partners, related to the gas supply for the Cleburne Plant.
Has she brought you up to speed on what we need?
We are looking into selling our stake in the plant and need to finalize the agreement as soon as we can.
Please let me know what you need to finish this.
Thanks.
Daren
