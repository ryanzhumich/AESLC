Rhett: I have asked the attorney that I am working with on this to call you directly  about their proposed tax rep language as well as their deletion of the  language in Part 3 regarding the delivery of tax docs.
I have enclosed below  the language that we currently have in the Schedule which they would not  accept and I believe you have their proposed language on the tax reps.
Thanks again for your help.
I just think that at this point it is easier for  the tax folks to talk directly to each other.
