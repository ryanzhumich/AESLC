Jeff, have you finalized how Jenn and Craig will split out the industrial  segments?
They should also come up with their business plans and a reporting  matrix similar to what you are doing with the desks.
How are you making out  at the desk level in implementing our previous discussions with Scott and the  remainder of the desks?
Regards
