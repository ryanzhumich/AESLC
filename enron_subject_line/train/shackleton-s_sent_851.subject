Sorry to keep sending emails BUT my assistant just walked in and said that  you were expecting a presentation by Mark Taylor on the phone call.
To my  knowledge, Mark doesn't know anything about this call (your email of 1/17  doesn't mention Mark).
So, I'm totally confused.
If we are going to discuss  the term sheet process and related tax issues, let's do it.
If you want to  cancel because you are expecting something different, please let me know (and  advise Lynn and Julian).
Thanks.
