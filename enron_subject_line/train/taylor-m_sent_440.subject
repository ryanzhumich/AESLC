Mark -  Would you be available to sit down with me Monday morning (say  beginning at 10:30) to go over the spreadsheet?
I have quite a few comments  on the financial transaction items that I was able to understand and several  questions on areas I haven't yet been able to decipher.
I am particularly  concerned about the Weather Products generally and the Floating Prices for  all financial products (the Index tab).
If you could let me or my assistant  know so I can work out my calendar for the day I'd appreciate it (I've  blocked out 2 hours but it might not take that long).
Unfortunately I'm  leaving town mid-afternoon so I have to get these wrapped up.
I'm at x37459.
Thanks!
