Jeff,  I want to bring  Aram Sogomonian back to Enron at a VP level.
According to new human resources procedures this decision requires a support of three senior executives.
I want to ask you to express your opinion on Aram (based on a phone interview or just on your past interactions with him).
You can send a reply to Norma  Villarreal at H/R.
Thanks.
