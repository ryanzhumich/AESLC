OK, this is hot off the press.
Tanya:  our Performance Impairment language limited the collateral call to  1.1 times outstanding exposure.
The collateral was defined only as Letters  of Credit and the issuing bank was at least A- S&P rated.
As to the  Threshold, well, you can read the response.
Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
