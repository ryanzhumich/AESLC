Attached please find the UPDATED responsibilities for the Global Contracts and Global Facilities teams.
Due to restructuring within our group, we have lost three team members (Anthony Campos, Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan, and Ryan Sheeren) to the physical gas confirmation group.
Our team members' individual responsibilities have changed as a result.
Please forward the attached information to your staff and coworkers.
Please call me at x30569 if you should have any questions.
Thanks,
