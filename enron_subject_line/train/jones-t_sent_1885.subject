Per our conversation yesterday, we would like to open the "Other Agreements"  information in the Financial Trading Agreement Database to members of the  Interest Rate and Currency Desk.
If possible, we would also like them to see  the comments screen.
The people who will need access are Laurel Adams,  George Garcia, Sheila Glover, Kelly Templeton, Teresa Brogan.
As usual, we would like to get them access ASAP.
Can you keep me posted on  their access.
Thanks!
