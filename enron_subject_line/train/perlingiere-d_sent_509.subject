Please see the attached Transaction Agreement and Master Firm Purchase/Sale  Agreement.
We are in receipt of signed faxes of the Transaction Agreement and Master  Agreement however,  we also need signed originals.
To that end,  "DRAFT" has  been removed from the attached documents for execution.
Please note, on the  first page of the Master Agreement  and Exhibit "C"  the blank  after "a".
Determine  the state of  incorporation for Huber, and file in the name of the  state.
Finally,  print two of each document,  have signed and send both to my  attention.
