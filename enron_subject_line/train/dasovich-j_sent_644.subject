Hi Kim: Any luck withJackie re: getting together to start the project?
And if there's anything else I can do re: your meeting on Monday, don't  hesitate.
Leave me a voicemail and let me know how the meeting goes.
I'll  be in Vancouver with the EBS gang Monday/Tuesday, and if all goes well maybe  I can chat up some folks while I'm there.
Best,
