Melissa,  We've got a counterparty with a draft of a master where the counterparty has  the rounding conventing for kilowatts at 6 decimal points.
Is that our  standard convention?
Thanks for your help!
P.S.
I have passed your request for a copy of that assignment to my  assistant Taffy Milligan.
She can get you copies of any documents in the  future.
