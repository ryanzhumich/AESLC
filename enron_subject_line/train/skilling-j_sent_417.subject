Ms. Robinson,   I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling, to whom Kay Cole introduced to you  via e-mail.
He would like to speak to you by phone regarding his daughter  Kristin's potential interest in attending Boston University.
Would you be  willing to provide us with your phone number?
Please let us know if there is anything we can do to assist you with your  future visits to Houston.
I looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Regards,
