Dave:  Here is the agreement I received from London which I have revised to apply to  the Chicago situation.
Let's consider this a rough draft at present.
It  does identify some interesting issues regarding how this will work.
let's  get together and go through it and see what we need and what we don't.
Let  me know what time works for you.
Mark
