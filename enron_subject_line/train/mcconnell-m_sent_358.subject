Brent, I would like to illustrate the growth of our commodities to show why  this a  great business unit and why this is a big focus for wholesale.
Also  we will use all of this for the Jan analyst meeting.
Please compile some facts on each business by  1. number of transactions 2. revenues 3. on line growth of each 4. size of each commodity;  e.g.
:  number of barrels traded, tons of coal,  tons of freight, etc.
5. other metrics that you think will illustrate the point   Go back as many years as you can get data.
Thanks,
