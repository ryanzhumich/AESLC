After looking over the deal, I need to ask Steve Jackson a couple of  questions.
So I probably will not be able to walk you through the deal today  because I have some questions myself on a couple of the legs.
I was hoping  to get this done today.
But for sure by the end of the week.
I want to ask  you some questions about how Richard wants the books to be changed.
See you  at 1:00.
