My apologies for any confusion resulting from my e-mail yesterday.
While the  GTC's must be finished this morning, Legal's revisions to the short and long  descriptions are not due until Friday August 6.
I think it would make sense  for us all to get together to discuss how these work early next week.
I will  ask Taffy to set something up.
