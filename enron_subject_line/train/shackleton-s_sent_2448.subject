Dennis:  Attached are two "templates" for power trades confirmed under an executed  ISDA Master Agreement, one is for a swap and the other for an option (cap or  floor).
Ignore the symbols and elections which are only to feed deal terms  into our confirmation system.
The specific terms of each trade (dates,  notional quantities, price indexes and pricing, etc.)
would be inserted into  the format.
I hope this helps.
