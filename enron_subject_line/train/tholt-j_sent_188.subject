Southwest Gas currently views Enron Online but is afraid to transact physical  volumes on it because they are afraid the payment terms on Enron Online are  different than non-EOL trades.
They stated that they reveiwed the EOL  contract and that it does not address payment.
I told them that the payment  terms do not differ but they are asking for something in writing.
Can you  send them something.
