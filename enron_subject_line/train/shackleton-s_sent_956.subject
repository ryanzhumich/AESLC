In connection with the trip to BA next week, I am having some problems  scheduling meetings with other consultants and would like to know whether you  have been able to schedule a meeting on Tuesday (Feb. 29) or Wednesday (March  1) with your colleagues and/or the ADA.
I would appreciate hearing from you  as quickly as possible in the morning because I already have requests to meet  on those two days.
I would obviously like to defer to your plans.
Please  call me tomorrow.
Thanks.
Sara
