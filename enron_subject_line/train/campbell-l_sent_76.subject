This is a message from Kerry.
I just converted and moved Larry Campbell (lcampbe) to the W2K server.
He  uses ESIS.
I successfully converted the tables and have the links corrected  (logged in as kgramse), however Larry cannot use the system.
I received a  message while logged in as Larry stating that the data/application was  "Read-Only" when I attempted to re-link the tables.
Please check the permissions on GTROS-FS01P\APPSRW   Thanks,
