Rob,   I got your name from Doug Leach.
He  thought that you would be the person to  talk to about this.
I got a call last night from Rudolph Maldonado.
(The operator forwarded him  our way.)
He stated that he has some natural gas to sell in Saudi Arabia.
His number is 562-866-1755.
Could you give him a call and check this out?
I  told him that I would find someone that he could discuss this with.
I can be reached at 3-6905 if you have any questions.
