Congratulations on your added role of CEO for Enron Europe.
I look forward  to continuing to work with you and the staff in London on risk management  operations initiatives.
I talk with Brent Price several times a week.
I know that Fernley has  appreciated his participation in London, and I hope that you have found his  involvement to be beneficial as well.
We are almost at the half way mark on  his assignment, so I will talk with you next week when I return from Calgary  to get your input on his role to date.
