Tanya:  Bill was assigned to this master which we sent out in 1997.
Per my email yesterday, we need new credit and a new person assigned.
I think Rod will handle credit when we dupe the ENA master for  EnronCredit.com.
Please let me know who will handle.
There are some issues that credit and  legal can determine before we resend a first draft.
Thanks.
Sara
