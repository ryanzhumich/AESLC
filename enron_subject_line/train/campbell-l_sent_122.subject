Scott, I have sent out twice a request to each of the field teams in the  Midland Region to provide some desperately needed tank information to  determine compliance for all the EOTT crude oil tanks in the Midland area.
So far, only the Midland, Lovington, Kermit, Andrews, Hobbs and Jal teams  have responded.
I would appreciate your assistance in motivating the  remaining seven teams to get this information to me at their earliest  convenience.
I have attached the most recent update of the tank spreadsheet  for you to pass on to the teams.
Thanks for the help.
