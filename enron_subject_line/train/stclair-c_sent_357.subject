John: As we discussed, here is a draft of a proposed amendment letter which covers  the issues that we talked about.
Depending upon how Leslie handles the  affiliate issue, more may be added to this.
Alos, as I ,mentioned to you,  this needs to be approved by the head of our Online group before I can sign  off on it.
I am in the process o getting that approval.
