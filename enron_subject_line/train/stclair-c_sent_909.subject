Susan and Samantha: We are in the process of completing a quarter end project called Project  Margaux and have completed the Raptor II project.
With respect to Project  Margaux, please coordinate with Mark Evans in London to get closing sets of  documents.
With respect to Raptor II, I will leav a message with Alicia  Curry at V&E to send you the closing sets.
I will leave with you my closing  binder on Raptor I.  Sara, It might not be a bad idea to meet with Brenda Funk in the next few weeks to  get updated on all of the qaurter end delas.
Carol
