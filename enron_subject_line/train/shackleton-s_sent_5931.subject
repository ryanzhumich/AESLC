Tracy:  The Allegheny swap side letter provides that the parties will make a good  faith effort to negotiate the ISDA master by April 6.
I am waiting with the  firrst redraft of the agreement but can't get a response from anyone as to  whom and where to send (via email).
I've left voice mails for Yair and Kate  at Allegheny and Lauren at Sullivan and Cromwell.
Can you exert some pressure here?
