I will be out of the office on Wednesday, January 3.
I am married to an OU  graduate, so we are headed to the Orange Bowl to hopefully see Oklahoma hang  onto their number 1 ranking.
I will be back in the office after lunch on  Thursday, January 4.
My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), has phone numbers where I can be  reached.
Please contact Bob Hall at x36956 with any questions while I am  out.
