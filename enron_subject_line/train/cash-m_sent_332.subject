Brian,   Pat Mackin requested that I forward this on to you.
I think he has a good  idea here to look at a process for RIF selection.
Currently, it is done on  an ad-hoc basis, with plans being prepared for each situation.
Pat, do you still have a copy of the one you prepared a while back?
It would  be an excellent start.
Thanks.
