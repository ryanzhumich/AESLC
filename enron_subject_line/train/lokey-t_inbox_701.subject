We are currently discussing several potential approaches for a "Phase VII" expansion project.
We have preliminary work underway on several potential scenarios, some of which might involve Gulfstream as an upstream transporter.
As part of these discussions, Gulfstream has inquired about FGT's interest in providing a capacity lease for backhaul service (approximately 20-30 miles - they did not identify the specific market).
My questions are: 	(1) Backhaul capacity lease with an interstate pipeline - Do you see any problems/issues?
The lease arrangement would be with Guflstream Pipeline.
(2) If this backhaul lease capacity is used by Gulfstream to provide deliveries to an electric generator, would the FP&L Favored Nations Clause be triggered?
