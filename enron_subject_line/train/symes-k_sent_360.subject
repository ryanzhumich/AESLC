I just received the e-mail regarding your visit to Portland (Monica Lande  forwarded it to me).
Regarding that, I would definitely be interested in  gaining access to Livelink.
Monica explained that Livelink is a system that  allows one to view confirms, in which case it would greatly benefit my  position to have access to it.
I look forward to your visit, and to working  with you in the future.
Thanks,
