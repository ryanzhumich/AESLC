I will be taking a 1/2 day of vacation on Friday.
I am trying to do the  majority of the necessary preparation for our trip before Friday.
I am also  still trying to decide whether or not we will do hair tonight.
Do you  already have the perm?
I did get some type of directions from Denise too.
I  am printing them now and placing them in my purse so we will have them.
