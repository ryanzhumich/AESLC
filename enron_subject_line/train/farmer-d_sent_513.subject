At Sweeney (Mtr 1517), for December, 6,000/day was confirmed to the Phillips  sale.
Acutally, we should have nominated a purchase of 4,000 and a sale of  10,000.
The original purchase deal had the incorrect year on the deal date.
So, I have created deal 148851.
Please reallocate mtr 1517 with these  changes; sale of 10,000 on deal 93804, purchase of 4,000 on 148851.
If you  have any questions, let me know.
