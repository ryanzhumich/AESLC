MIchael:  I will be over for the ISDA board meeting on January 25 and 26.
With the  launch of the credit derivatives business, I think it would be a good time to  do a brief Securities Law/Chinese Wall seminar relating to the credit  business.
I would propose to review the rules we have instituted in NA and  particular issues in the European market.
My preference on timing is in the  morning on the 26th, and second, in the afternoon on the 25th.
Please give  your thoughts on this.
Take care.
Mark
