Sorry to have missed you at the investor presentation last week, if you or beau want any of the slides please let me know and we will forward them.
Now that our venture activity is defined and stable, we are starting to look at phase two of genesis park's evolution, which includes advisory services.
As you can imagine, we see a lot of deal flow that isn't a good fit for the fund, but we feel that we could assist on a fee basis.
To that end, we have an interest in identifying an impact player from the investment banking world who can drive that aspect of our business.
Ideal profile would be new york experience with a background that included both energy and IT.
Given the turmoil in the markets, we are asking a few of our investors if they know of anyone with those characteristics that either is in houston already or has a significant tie to the community.
Thanks, and i trust you know that we would be pleased to help enron in any way if there is a need to rationalize any business lines that now seem non-strategic.
