We were cut 40 MW today by BPA for peak hours on 6/18 at COB on enpower deal number 305699.
Lisa purchased replacement power from Avista at $30.
Enpower 897712  We presold power to Avista at $33.50 for the month and are now buying it back from them at $30 to book out.
Of course, BPA should not charge us for the 27.25 supply price under their contract.
