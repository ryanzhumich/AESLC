Yan,  The merged reports look great.
I believe the only orientation changes are to  "unmerge" the following six reports:    31 Keystone Receipts 15 Questar Pipeline 40 Rockies Production 22 West_2 23 West_3 25 CIG_WIC  The orientation of the individual reports should be correct.
Thanks.
Mat  PS.
Just a reminder to add the "*" by the title of calculated points.
