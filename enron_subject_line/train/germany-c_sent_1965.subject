-       Subject: Cute story   Anyone who's been single and over the age of 18 can relate to this.
When I was younger I hated going to weddings ...it seemed that all of my  aunts and the grandmotherly types used to come up to me, poking me in the  ribs and cackling, telling me, 'You're next.'
?
They stopped that crap after  I started doing the same thing to them at funerals.
