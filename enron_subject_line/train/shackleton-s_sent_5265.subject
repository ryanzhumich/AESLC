Below is a document containing "General Terms and Conditions" which is ALWAYS  attached to a financial confirmation when the parties have no executed master  agreement.
If Ed, Tracy or someone in credit needs to add credit to the  transaction, then we ALSO attach an Annex B (counterparty specific credit  provisions),  Annex B-1(collateral and exposure provisions) and a letter of  credit format.
I am only attaching the General Terms and Conditions.
Let me know if you still want to see the ISDA Master Agreement (preprinted  boilerplate consisting of an agreement and Credit Support Annex which I  cannot email) together with a sample Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the Credit  Support Annex (which are the two "customized" pieces negotiated by legal) .
Thanks.
Sara
