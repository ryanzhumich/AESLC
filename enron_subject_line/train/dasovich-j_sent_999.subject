FYI.
Attached is a presentation on gas markets that I gave to an electricity  group yesterday.
The group was formed out of California's restructuring  legislation (AB 1980).
It's called the "AB 1980 Implementation Group" (I  heard that the group decided that its time to change its name.).
The group  includes just about all of the interest groups in California.
I focused on the fact that gas offers a model of a "real" market that  California should look to in order to fix the "artificial" and failed  electricity model created by AB 1980.
Best,
