Hey guys,   I just wanted to give you a friendly reminder to please have someone go through all your books to look for any deals with ECC and a third counterparty for October and November 2001 production.
I'll try to find as many as I can, but I'm not as familiar with all of your books as you are, and I don't want any deals to be missed.
If you come across any deals can you please flip them to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible as there are only a couple more days left this month, and settlements needs to get started on invoicing.
Please let me know if you have any questions on this.
Thanks
