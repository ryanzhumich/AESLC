Attached is a short letter advising subs/affiliates of ENA of existing  brokerage and futures accounts.
I thought these should be sent to the  general counsel and CFO/Treasurer of each company.
Please let me know your  comments, frequency of review, whether any other group should monitor, etc.
Each attached Exhibit will contain only a list of accounts.
I have not  included account numbers but we can do so and include any other information  you consider relevant.
Remember, the only other "brokerage account matrix"  which we have produced is a quick view of brokerage firms and Enron  companies.
Thanks.
