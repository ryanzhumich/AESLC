Jeff,  We met at moderators training in Dallas.
I saw the announcement that you stepped down for personal reasons.
Please do not forget your forum as they are a great resource at times like these.
If you need an other trusting, confidential ear please do not hesitate to call me or one of the others you met at moderators training.
Just a quick note to say good luck and you are not alone.
Norman
