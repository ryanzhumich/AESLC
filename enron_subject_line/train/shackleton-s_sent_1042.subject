We have been asked to assist in the setting up of an account with Morgan for  the sale of this stock (through John Greene) held in the name of "Enron  Communications Investments Corp.".
Restrictions (technically expired on  3/12/00) on the shares are in the process of being lifted by the transfer  agent.
Let me know if you need further information.
We are working with Mike  Deville and Gill Melman (ECI legal).
Thanks.
Sara
