Please join me on Thursday, January 11 from 1:00 to 4:00 pm for a special  information session for the Operations Management teams supporting Enron  Americas, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets.
We will focus  on assessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.
Details on the  location for the meeting will be sent to you early this week.
I look forward to seeing everyone at this meeting on the 11th.
The things  that we will discuss will be important for each and every one of you as you  carry out your roles in 2001.
I hope that you will make every effort to  attend.
Please let me know as soon as possible if you have a conflict that  will keep you from attending the meeting.
