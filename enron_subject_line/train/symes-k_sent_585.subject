Per your request for year-to-date numbers: here's an example of what I could  include in the daily EOL summary.
Let me know if this is helpful for you, and  if you'd like it included on the graph sheet.
I think it might be too tight  to fit on the page as it is, but there's no reason why we can't generate a  two-page report.
As long as we're going in that direction, is ther any other  data you'd like to see in graph form?
