Chuck,  Do we have a rescheduled date for the deposition of the plaintiff?
Given the  correspondence I've been receiving about rescheduling other depositions, we  probably should set forth a date in Nov/Dec and get a protective order from  the court stating that it cannot be rescheduled.
Otherwise, even if we do  "agree" on dates, there likely would be additional delays.
I am ready to  hear what this guy has to say about my client.
Let me know your thoughts.
Thanks.
Michelle
