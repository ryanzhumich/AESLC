Gossett officially asked me for my accomplishments today.
I have to have  them done by tomorrow night.
So I guess that's what I'll be doing the rest  of the day(not that I've had that many accomplishments just that it'll take  me that long to think of something.)
I knew I might as well add that last  crack b/c if I didn't you would have!
