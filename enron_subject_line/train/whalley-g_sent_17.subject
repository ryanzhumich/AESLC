Joe,  I have slotted you 90 minutes w/Greg on Wednesday @ 4:00 p.m.  Greg is  scheduled to participate in a Houston conference call @ 5:30 p.m.  You guys  are connecting again for dinner.
Please let me know the time and location  for dinner on Wednesday night.
Also, Greg says his schedule is open enough  that he would like to hang out on the floor w/you and your guys.
He will be  officing over by John Sherriff and the mobile number he's carrying is +44   7901516638.
Many Thanks,  Liz Taylor
