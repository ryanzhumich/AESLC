Jeff,  I fully support Sandeep's request to move Anshuman Srivastav to Houston.
I anticipate that we shall be working on Dhabol related issues for the next  two years until all the business problems are successfully resolved.
Anshuman is a very capable employee, with the right combination of skills to attack the Dhabol modeling challenge.
He understands the Indian markets as  well as international fuel markets.
He has also a very good grasp of power industry fundamentals and of the technology used at the Dhabol power  plant.
