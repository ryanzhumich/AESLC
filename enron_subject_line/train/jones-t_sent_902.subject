On the list for 3/20/00, the only counterparty I am responding for is  Carthage Energy.
Eventually I will be making the Australian responses, but  we are not there yet.
On the 3/21/00 list, National Energy was amended, and I had no changes to my  previous approvals.
Western Resources is an amended counterparty and I am  opening them up for all financial and power.
