It was good seeing you.
Thanks for dinner.
Shawna and I were waiting for  your call about a coffee (she even said she'd buy!
), but I guess we missed  you for this trip.
She sends her regards!
I harassed Justy about his movie career.
He told me he was the body double  for Russell Crowe.
I asked him whether he and/or his horse had hired agents  yet (depending on who was getting better reviews!)
Keep me posted on the house.
It looked great!
