My husband and his friends want me to inquire more about your fishing lodge  and prices.
A bunch of them turn 50 next year and are thinking of going on a  fishing trip.
Can you give me any more information on prices and  availiablity for next year.
Please advise what is included in the price and  where we  need to fly into.
If you have any brochures, canyou send them to  me at Jane Tholt, 7502 Highland Farms Rd., Houston, TX 77095  .
Hope you  have a great day and it was great seeing you.
