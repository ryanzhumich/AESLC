Jim Reilly said he had spoken to you recently after he saw me holding a sign under an I10 overpass.
Would love to get together with you to catch up and figure out what's going on at Enron and elsewhere.
I have attached my resume'.
We've all come along way since the BT days.
I'll call you in the near future to see when we can get together.
