Lynn Aven and I are in the process of finalizing a memo on the Argentina trip  and we will also have a separate list of "action points" for Mike G.  I am  not planning to do anything further with respect to Argentina per your  instructions (eg, there is an ADA conference in June and we have been asked  to provide a speaker; we have been asked to comment on the ADA local master  format; finalizine trader guidelines and termsheet format).
Also, I am not  planning to do anything further with respect to Brazil other than finalize  our financial trading matrix.
I have cancelled my trip to Sao Paulo at the  end of March and will table the "derivatives training" indefinitelly.
