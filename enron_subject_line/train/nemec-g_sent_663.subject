Chris attached is a clean and redline version of the Gregg Agreement with my  revisions.
The form Gregg sent was the original form they had forwarded for  the first project.
I change to reflect the change we made at that time.
As  you will notice it is quite a few changes.
However, since Gregg signed off  on this form once already, they shouldn't have a problem doing it again.
Let  me know if you have any questions.
