Wade,   I understood your number one priority was to deal with your vehicle  situation.
You need to take care of it this week.
Lucy can't hold the  tenants to a standard (vehicles must be in running order with valid stickers)  if the staff doesn't live up to it.
If you decide to buy a small truck and  you want to list me as an employer for credit purposes, I will vouch for your  income.
