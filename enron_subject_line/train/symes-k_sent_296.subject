I have changed the following deals to reflect a monthly expiry frequency  instead of daily:  483753 483759 483765 483766  Since I don't enter options very often, and have only done daily options  before, I'm still getting familiar with all the different parameters of the  deals.
I'm sorry for the confusion.
Thanks for catching that.
