Kim & Frank,  I received a call last week from a Brian Laurie with PG&E.
Brian indicated that PG&E was splitting their Pipeline and LDC businesses into two separate units/companies.
Brian was asking about what kind of agreements that NNG has in place dealing with our LDC business.
I'm not sure how much or what kind of information that we feel comfortable in sharing with PG&E on this issue.
Can you give me some insight into what information we may want to share or who may need to discuss this with PG&E.
