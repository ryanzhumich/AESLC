Hi Lee:  Looks great.
Could you do me a favor?
You have "generating company" rep on  the agenda.
Enron does not see itself as a generating company.
In fact, the  only generation that we own in California is 50+ MWs of wind power in  Southern California.
Could you change it to "energy service provider" rep?
Hope that's not a problem.
Best,
