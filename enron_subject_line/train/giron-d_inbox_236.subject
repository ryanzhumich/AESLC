Thank you for agreeing to write a letter of recommending me for the Analyst Program.
I appreciate your time and opinion.
I have included a one page outline to help give you an idea of my accomplishments, job performance, and job development.
This outline is a guideline to help you.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you again.
