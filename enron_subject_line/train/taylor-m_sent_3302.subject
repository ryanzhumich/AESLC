I will be on vacation from Monday the 19th through Monday the 26th (returning  to the office on Tuesday the 27th).
My cell phone and pager will not work  either at sea or in the countries I will be visiting.
I can be reached via  Maritime Communications Network at (877)225-7447 - you will need to give my  name and the name of the ship - Celebration.
Since the rates are around $10  per minute, I don't plan to check my voicemail as often as usual but will  call in when in port.
