Claire,  In response to my phone message of  1 February, 2001,  attached are two  agreements for your review.
First is a GISB revised in acceptable form to  ENA.
I have incorporated UGI's Special Revisions into ENA's save number  (3).
Also, with regards to number (2),   "three business days" has been  changed to "five" and revisions to  the last two sentences.
Finally, also attached is a draft of ENA's Master Firm Purchase/Sale  Agreement.
Upon your review, please give me a call to discuss the attached.
Regards,
