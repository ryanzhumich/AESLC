Could I arrange a very short conversation with you regarding the May 28, 1999  memo from Jorge Brito Pereira?
I would like to discuss your analysis and any  further actions which the local firm may be taking on ECTRIC's behalf.
I  have a paper trade with a Portuguese corporate pending receipt of an  enforceability opinion acceptable to ECT.
I'm not sure if we'll get there.
I'm interested in further discussions you may have had internally or  externally.
