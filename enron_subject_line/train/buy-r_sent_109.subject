A "Doorstep" inspection of this business was performed in accordance with our  procedures and apparently this business is a disaster!!!
We need immediate  action on this up to and including shutting it down.
This was the worst we  have seen at Enron and I don't even want to put in this email what I heard  was going on there.
We need a coordinated solution here asap to avoid a real disaster, if there  isn't one already.
I'll speak with Rick Causey here about what immediate  action we should take but the more you guys can dig into this the better.
More to come.
Rick
