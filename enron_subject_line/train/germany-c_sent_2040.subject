I have a tax bill to Columbia Energy Services in the amount of $5,606.78 for  gas stored at the Bear Creek Storage facility.
The amount is $5,606.78 and  it is for the the 2000 tax year.
I was notified about this yesterday and I  think it was due on 12/31/2000.
How do you want to handle this?
I was going to pay it and bill New Power for  the whole amount.
I will also have our tax department fax a copy to Jeff.
