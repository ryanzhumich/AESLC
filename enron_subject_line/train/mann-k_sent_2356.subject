Hi there,  I'm attaching the final forms of the assignment/assumption agreements for  GE's acknowledgement.
It is pretty close to what you saw last week.
It  would be a big help if we could have these executed  by GE today or  tomorrow.
A faxed signature would work, then we could have the originals  picked up from Lee's office.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
