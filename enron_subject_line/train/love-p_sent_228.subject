Kam asked that I email you guys about the FT-ONTARIO book move.
Please move  the book for Price, Basis and Index from FT-ONT-CENTRAL to FT-ONTARIO.
This  also encompasses splitting out the price and basis and fixing the curves in  the curve table.
This needs to be done by Monday night, 7/31.
Thanks for  you help and please shout with any questions.
