Ted,  I think you had, at one point, asked me if the first U.T.
football game was  Labor Day weekend.
It is actually the weekend after Labor Day (Sept. 9)  against Louisiana-Lafayette at 11:30 a.m.
So basically it should be a very  challenging game and relatively cool (Ha!).
Hope your day's going well.
Shorty  FYI - U.T.
plays Stanford at Stanford Sept. 16 (7:15 p.m. kick-off)
