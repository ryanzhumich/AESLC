Russell: We have received excerpts from Global's LLC Agreement.
Its members are  Global Petroleum Corp., YPF Distribution Company and Montello Oil  Corporation.
It is managed by a Board of 3 reps selected by each member and  for this purpose, Global and Montello are treated as 1 member and YPF is  treated as 1 member.
I still need to talk to you about why we want an  ownership change trigger in the ISDA and if we do, at what level.
