As you are all aware, the legal department has grown significantly over the  last several months.
While so far we have been able to find places for  everyone to sit, we have not added significantly to the available file  cabinet space on the floor.
In fact, a number of file cabinets are now in  locations where they will not be able to remain due to fire code requirements.
Please review the files you currently have stored outside your own office  space and, after condensing, archiving and destroying as many as possible,  give an inventory of your current usage and needs to your group leader.
Once  we have an accurate picture of our needs, we can come up with a plan to  allocate the available file cabinet space.
Most if not all of us will have  to make significant sacrifices and modify our filing practices so that we  each reduce our file space usage to our fair share.
