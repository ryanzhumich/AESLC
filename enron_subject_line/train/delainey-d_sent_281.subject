Ike, with the danger of being too presumptious,  I thought I would follow up  with an e-mail to suggest a procedure for trading settlement offers on  Wednesday.
Attached I have a suggested template for each party to use so  that we can ensure that we are comparing "apples to apples".
I would also  suggest that each party provide sufficient back-up to justify their numbers.
It may also be helpful for TVA and EPMI to use an independent party, such as  Charles Bone, as the intermediary to facilitate the transfer of each parties  settlement offer.
I am in the office over the next several days.
Lets discuss at your earliest  convenience.
Regards
