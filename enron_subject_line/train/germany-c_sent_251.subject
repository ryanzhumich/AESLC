Call me when you get a chance.
There is some new capacity to execute for  November.
Expiring contracts are show in purple, the new contracts are shown  in yellow.
Ignore the demand charges for now, I did not verify them.
I  won't execute these until I hear from you.
The capacity listed below was purchased from the pipeline.
Scott said Jeff  gave us the OK on this one.
