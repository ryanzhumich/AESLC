Mark Elliott tells me that you drafted some trader guidelines (physical and  financial) for the London traders.
I am trying to develop similar guidelines  for the Southern Cone regions (first Argentina) and thought your expertise  would be very helpful.
Could you send me a set?
I'm leaving for Sao Paulo  on Saturday but I will be in the office tomorrow.
Thank you for your help.
Regards.
