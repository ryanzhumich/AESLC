I received a call from the consultant who performed the archeology survey at  stations 1 and 2.
Based upon the plot plan provided by construction, the  archeology discovery at station 1 does not occur within the area of proposed  impact, even though  part of the discovery is within the facility fence.
The  report  recommendation to the SHPO by the archeologist will be that during  construction activities in this area, an archeologist be onsite to monitor  and ensure that the site is not impacted.
They will also recommend that we  fence the discovery area within our facility to ensure that future pipeline  activities will not disrupt the site.
I have asked that two reports be prepared for each site.
One report for each  station covering the construction areas and the other reports to include the  entire 40 acres at each compressor station.
All four reports will be  submitted to Bret Fritch in Omaha on Monday, the 26th of March.
