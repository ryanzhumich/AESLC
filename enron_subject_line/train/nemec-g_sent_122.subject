Brian,  Attached is a draft of the termination letter.
The letter assumes  the letter agreement was executed.
There also appears to be an agency  agreement which appointed Merrick as agent for ROW acquisition.
This is also  terminated by the letter.
I haven't heard from Shonnie yet.
Please review  and add any comments you have.
Thanks
