Hi, Just to let you know we are planning to go to Conroe on Sunday for a few hours visit and then immediately return home.
That seems the best day to take them to lunch and get back by dark.
We are also feeding the neighbors dogs  etc.
while they are gone so we need to get back.
Hope Lauren is feeling better and everyone else is OK. Got my fingers crossed that the weather holds thru the first of the year and that no one is sick.
Love, Mom
