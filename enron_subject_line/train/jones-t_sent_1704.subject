Per my conversation with Frank, this counterparty wants to trade weather  online.
However, they have the old style ERMS Master in place which only  covers energy commodities.
I spoke to Scott Tackett on the Confirm Desk, and  he is going to add language to the confirm that puts the trades under the  master agreement.
I also spoke to Tanya Rohauer in Credit and she is going  to move this counterparty up on the list for an ISDA replacement master.
So, they are OK to open for weather.
