Hi Sylvia,  Re the GISB for Wisconsin,  no we would not agree to the terms of their GISB  on the front page or their special provisions.
Are you aware we currently  have a GISB in place with Wisconsin Public Service Company and ENA as well as  with Wisconsin Gas Company??????
Re Master Status:  I have devoted  my afternoon to this contract  in order to  complete the redline.
Will keep you apprised.
Do you still want a copy of our GISB.
If so, I will send you a draft  however,  I need to fill in the name  of the counterparty etc.
before it goes  out.
