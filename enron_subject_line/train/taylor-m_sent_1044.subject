The Houston desk has asked me to prepare a form of confirm for a credit  derivative based on the bankruptcy of a Canadian reference entity.
Before I  talk to Canadian counsel about the bankruptcy laws there I thought I should  check with you guys and make sure you haven't done this already - any issues  you know of?
Thanks, Mark
