I just composed a somewhat lengthy e:mail about the anniversary trip, and  then closed out Lotus Notes and checked discard changes.
So it is gone - but  not sent!!
Can you e:mail me back your office phone number and if it is  convenient for you, I will give you call and use old fashioned technology.
