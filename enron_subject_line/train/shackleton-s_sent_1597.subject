Mark:  ENA is looking into derivatives trading with an Indian corporate.
My  latest information is the opinion from 1/14/97 rendered by Crawford Bayley &  Co. (which was part of our global survey effort a few years ago).
Do you  have anything more recent?
The ENA inquiry came from the pulp and paper  group.
Thanks for your help.
