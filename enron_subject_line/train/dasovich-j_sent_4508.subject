This is a very good, easily digestible summary of the FERC order.
Alan  Zaremberg, CEO of the Chamber and located in Sacramento, asked if we had a  summary that we could provide him.
Zaremberg is convinced that no one in  California understands what FERC did and wanted to try to educate them.
If  we sanitize it to remove anything sensitive, are folks comfortable providing  it to Zaremberg?
Thanks.
Best,
