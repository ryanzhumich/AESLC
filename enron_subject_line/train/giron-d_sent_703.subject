I believe we are in agreement on the new deal amounts.
I held back  $1,087,409 from the MEH book.
The MEH book lost $ mostly because there was  $20K added to the P&L last Friday.
I did not add that amount back in  tonight.
I don't know what it is.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Let me  know if there is something you want me to send you.
Thanks.
DG
