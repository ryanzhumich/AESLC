After our meeting last week I spoke to Mary about getting a list of the  products trading restrictions in our financial master and I haven't received  it.
With Mary out I don't know who to contact to get it, can you help me  with this?
Also, would it be possible to get a list of the global contract  numbers for our financial masters?
Thanks!
