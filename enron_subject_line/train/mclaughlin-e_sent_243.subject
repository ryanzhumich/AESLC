Deal NN6788.1 with Citibank has been killed.
This was an EOL deal that  Citibank and John Arnold agreed to cut in half.
Deal QF9221.1 was booked in  Dec. for half the volume of the original deal.
Unfortunately, deal NN6788.1  was not killed when we booked the new deal.
Please call me with any  questions.
Thanks,
