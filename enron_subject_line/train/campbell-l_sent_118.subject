On behalf of EOTT, an environmental records review was completed for a block  of Koch crude oil pipeline assets located in south Texas.
There were no  issues or environmental deficiencies identified during the review.
A due  diligence was recommended to verify confirmation of the housekeeping   activities presented in the records review.
The air permit modification for the La Plata C/S was received from the state  of Colorado.
This modification allows for additional emissions and fuel use  as a result of  a change in gas quality supplies in the San Juan basin.
