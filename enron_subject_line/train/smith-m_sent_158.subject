Matt,  Hey, thanks for returning my call.
As you're probably out from work, I'll  try you again when I get in tomorrow (thursday).
I basically just wanted to  touch base again since Ken has now moved on and left me with our synthetic  storage project.
I'm also looking for a legal and EOL contact to help us  develop a contract and run the bid process through EOL.
You may have  provided these to Ken, but I can't get in touch with him.
Thanks again.
