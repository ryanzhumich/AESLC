Please accept my apologies for this worksheet's absence yesterday.
It was  undergoing cosmetic improvements to more accurately represent the EES-EPMI  position.
Note two new column headings as of 3/27 - "Transmission" and "Other  EnPower" deals.
Also, a change has been made to the SP-15 volumes in the 3/2  sheet.
This change was made per Daniel Kang at EES and Chris Foster at EPMI.
And as always, feel free to contact me with questions.
Thanks,
