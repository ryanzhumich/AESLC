More questions:  We have two different levels of guarantee values.
We have the specific  performance levels, which if not met can result in termination, etc.
This  includes emissions, electrical output, heat rate, water (consumption and  discharge).
Will all of these have  more stringent guaranteed levels that  FCE will have to work to try to fix?
I'm assuming there are no sound  issues.
Thanks again,
