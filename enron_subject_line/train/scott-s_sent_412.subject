Doug, Ashley's e-mail address is in the cc line if you want to get in touch  with her.
I hadn't thought that she might have had to put down a refundable  deposit (rather than a hookup fee) for some of the utilities so logistically  switching to your name might not be worthwhile, but it may be worth asking.
Remember I have water covered.
Call or e-mail if you have questions!
