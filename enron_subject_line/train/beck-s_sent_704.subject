I am taking Good Friday as my discretionary holiday for the year.
I will be  in Austin with my daughter for her official tour and info session at UT, plus  a look at dorms.
Patti will have numbers where I can be reached in Austin.
We are making final changes to the orig presentation today - I will be  reviewing those tomorrow in Austin.
I am e:mailing you a current draft  version, although it does not yet reflect all of the changes needed.
I am  still trying to eliminate some pages to make it more a more manageable size.
I have taken the work that Rahil and Fred have done on the services and have  made that into an appendix - nice work, but way too much detail for a  presentation.
