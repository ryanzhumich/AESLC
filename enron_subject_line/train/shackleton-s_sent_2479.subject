Larry:  According to Steve Kessler (the DB lawyer in New York who is negotiating the  ENA ISDA Master), London e-commerce issues are normally handled ty the London  lawyer (Conrad Libischer at 44-20-754-52705).
If  NY trader is also  involved, then DB must decide on one lawyer to handle password application,  etc.
The ENA ISDA Master must first be approved by Frankfurt.
I don't know how  long this takes.
You may want to let the DB trader start the EOL process.
Thanks.
