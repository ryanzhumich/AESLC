I'm working with the "Click Paper.com" legal team toward the migration of the  pulp & paper trades to that website.
In oder to determine whether any of the  counterparties that have actually traded pulp & paper online have amended the  ETA, I need to get a list of the counterparties that have trade pulp & paper  online.
Can someone down there prepare such a list for me?
Thanks!
