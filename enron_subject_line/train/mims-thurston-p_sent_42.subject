Hi Jeannie,  Several months ago I met with Jennifer Milligan regarding part-time  employment.
I still have an interest in this area, and thought I would drop  you a note to see if you know of any upcoming opportunities/positions within  the company.
I have no definite time frame, but I do know that I do have a  strong interest in part-time employment.
Please let me know if anything  comes up, and also if we need to meet.
I would appreciate discretion regarding my search for part-time employment (  please do not discuss with Hunter) as I do not want to jeopardize my position  on the desk or have him thinking that I'm not giving 100% because I'm  interested in part-time employment.
I've casually mentioned this to him in  the past, so he's somewhat aware, but probably did not take me very seriously.
Thanks for your help!
