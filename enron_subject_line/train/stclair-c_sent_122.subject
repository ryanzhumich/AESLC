As we discussed last week, we are in the process of scheduling lunch seminars  with credit, confirms/settlements and global contracts for the following  dates:  May 5th, 12th and 24th.
Please let Sara and I know ASAP if you plan to be out onh any of these dates  as we feel that it is very important that you attend.
Tana: Have you talked to the Global Contracts Group about the 24th?
