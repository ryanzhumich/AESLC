Scott: I have been monitoring drafts of the swap docs.
Are you or someone else in  your group reviewing the other docs that involve Enron Corp. such as the  Certificate Purchase Agreement that appears to have a bunch of reps that  Enron has to make?
I( have not been paying to much attention to the docs  that don't involver the swap.
