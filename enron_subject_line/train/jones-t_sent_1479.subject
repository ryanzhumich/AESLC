Ted,  Question 15 of the annual NYMEX hedge exemptions asks us to describe in  detail:  "the system of internal controls administered in the supervision of  the applican't risk management programs, i.e., describe the risk assessment  policies and procedures in place for evaluation and supervision of risk  management programs, including "stress-testing" for extraordinary price  volatility, and state frequency supervision is conducted."
Attached is the response we have given the NYMEX in prior years.
Are there  any changes in our procedures/control that would necessiate a change in that  language?
