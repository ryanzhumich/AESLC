Paul:  Enjoyed your talk in San Antonio.
Now for the real issues:  could you  send to me the confirmation templates that you have devised for credit  derivatives in the UK?
Also, are there any other materials which might be  helpful in the credit derivatives area?
Shari has passed this on to me and  I'm reviewing a couple of Deutsche Bank transactions executed last month.
Thanks.
Sara
