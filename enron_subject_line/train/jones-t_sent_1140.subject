Whenever we supersede and replace one Enron guaranty with another, we are  supposed to have the "supersede and replace" language in the new guaranty.
Is there some reason why it's not in there, and if we can't get it in at this  late date, how are we going to make sure we don't have two live Enron  guarantees out with the counterparty?

Is there some reason one the state of Oregon is bolded in the guaranty?
