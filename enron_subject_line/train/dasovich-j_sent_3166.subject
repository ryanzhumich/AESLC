Hi: Hope you're well.
Based on your note, I faxed my Direct Deposit change to  Renee Kelso a week or so ago and wanted to check with her to see that she'd  received it and that it was in process, but I can't find her name in email.
Any suggestions on how I can check in and see how progress is going?
As  always, thanks a bunch.
Best,
