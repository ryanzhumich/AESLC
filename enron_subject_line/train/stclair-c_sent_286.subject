Russell: Our confirms desk has informed me that Aquila Risk Management has not been  executing confirmations that are sent to them and apparently the reason for  this was that they ere waiting for the Utilicorp Master to be put in place.
Now that we have completed the Master, is there some way that we can get  these confirms executed?
I will send you a list of deals shortly, but I'm  assuming that given the language that we have in the Master that there should  be no problem in signing the existing confirms that reference the existing  Aquila Master.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Carol
