Our upstream is Dynegy deal # 570332.1 Mid C HLH  Our Downstream is WWP deal # 339963.1  The path:  West Kootenai (G)-BCH(T)JUANITA/BCUS O#M335781A-WKPL-DYPMI-SNPD(T)BPA(T)BCUS/AVA O#96062 HNF-DYPMI-EPMI-WWP    MONTH LONG TAG 26019  HE 0700-0800 we are warned by SNPD that the transmission MAY BE curtailed to Zero.
When I spoke with Susan at WWP she finds this very suspicious, as it was described to her as a "West of Hatwai" problem she is suspicious of this and is investigating.
Please get with DYPMI and get their re-supplied transmission before this schedule flows in the morning.
