I spoke to the professors and we decided that the Midcontinent class will be held Monday's and Wednesday's from 3:00 to 4:00, Ontario class will be held Tuesday's and Thursday's at the same time.
Classes will commence Monday 8, 2001, and will continue until Thursday 19, 2001.
Midcontinent test will be held on Monday the 22nd and Ontario test will be held on Tuesday the 23rd.
Please e-mail any suggestions, conflict, registry.
