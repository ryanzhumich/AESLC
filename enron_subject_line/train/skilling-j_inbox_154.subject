Dear Richard,  As per my conversation with Jeff Skilling last week in which he suggested that I contact you, I would like to request the names of the companies who we outsource some of our accounting needs to.
I would like to target them for our latest product: Data Storage Capacity.
Please let me know how you would like me to proceed regarding this matter.
Thank you.
