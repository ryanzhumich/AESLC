Here are details of the problem we're having with the Tagg IQ Reports:  Three Mid-Columbia futures trades were executed by Matt Motley, Long Term  Southwest Desk, on 2/5, 2/6, and 2/7.
Trades pulled into Tagg IQ Reports -  All three pull into Future Daily Transaction Report (RSX0245F.IQR)   Only two pull into Future Net Position Summary (RXSNSUMF.IQR)  All three pull into Tagg Exchange Capture search - transaction IDs are  980362/983837/987050  All three pulled into Tagg Metacalc (Meta ID 77771 - Post ID 1035917 - Post  ID 77880 - Post ID 1037269) until 2/9 - NOW GONE  Because today is the Nymex Electricity Futures exercise date, we need to know  as soon as possible for our calculations whether or not these deals are in  the system, and if not, where they went.
My confusion lies in the fact that I  can find these deals when I do a search in Tagg for any futures deals traded  at the Mid-C settlement index, and yet the Risk group can no longer see  anything for Mid-C in their calculation.
Please let me know what you find.
Thank you,
