I spoke to Edmund to get the scoop on what we are going to be doing on the  confirms for Credit Derivatives, and he said that his current understanding  is that all of the confirms will be done out of London.
I communicated that  to Bob Bowen.
He also said that London was going to be hiring 120 people to  deal with the Credit Derivatives business.
Wow!
