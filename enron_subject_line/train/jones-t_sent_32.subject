Per Bill's email, I faxed a proposed form of Enron Corp. Guaranty to the  counterparty.
Please do not approve any trades with this counterparty until  due diligence is done on Italian law, which appears the be the place of  incorporation of the counterparty.
I will not assign the review of Italian  law to an attorney until we receive your credit worksheet.
If you feel we  need to proceed with this now let me know and I will get someone to start  looking at it.
