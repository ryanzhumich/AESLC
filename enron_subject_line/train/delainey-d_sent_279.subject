Joe, part of this deal is repayment of the sub debt at par and a series of  cashflows that we would probably like to monetize.
Have you looked at this?
Jeff, I would like to get your view on the economics - basically they are  giving us 89% of our carry value in cash and 11% of our carry value in a  contingent payment payable at restructuring or sale of their partnership.
Lets discuss ASAP.
