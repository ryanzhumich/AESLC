Hi Mark,  I don't know  what these folks are up to.
In fact, I didn't know that Scott  Laidlaw was involved.
When I spoke with EECC I told them that they needed to  get direction from you, someone from Mike Coleman's group, or an ENA  developer.
Any word from the Co Op/PB team?
I have jury duty in just a little while, so I'll be out of touch for a short  while.
Kay
