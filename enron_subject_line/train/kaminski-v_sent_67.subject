Phillip,  How can I install new programs on my laptop, without  the administrator's privileges?
One example: when I travel I use AOL to get access to my mail and to communicate with the office.
Windows 2000 does not allow  me to install it.
Also, I have my private statistical software I often use when I work at night during business trips.
I would like to load it as well.
Vince
