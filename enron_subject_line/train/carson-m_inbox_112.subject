We finally got signed up with a internet service provider.
I have attached a business card with our current pertinent information.
If for some reason the card doesn't work, drop one back and I will just send the info.
Hope all is well with everyone.
Tina and I have a joint email as well.
It is cntspain@swbell.net.
