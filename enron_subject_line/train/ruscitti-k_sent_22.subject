TJ,  Thanks for the congratulatory message you left on our voicemail - it made us  feel great.
We actually didn't go on a honeymoon - we will take one sometime next year.
We've just been swamped with the house we recently bought.
We bought an old small  bungalow in the city.
What a money pit.
Hope everything is going great.
Tell  everyone we said hi.
Thanks again,
