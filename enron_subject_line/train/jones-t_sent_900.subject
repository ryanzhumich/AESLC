We discussed your training in our group meeting yesterday, and Mark gave me  the go ahead to do a training, preferably a lunch training, sometime in  April.
If you could get together with the members of our team and send me an  email of any items in particular you would like addressed, we will try to  address them in our training.
Also, if you could get some dates for me we'll  check them against our schedule.
Would your group organize this lunch or  ours?
How many people are we talking about.
Only Global Contract or Global  Counterparty too?
Let me know the details so we can start planning...
