Mark Elliott just introduced me to another charming aspect of English  culture, the Morris Men.
I've got their website bookmarked.
Y'all are a  goofy bunch.
Dancing around in strange costumes, beating each other with  switches.
It's funny, each one of you imparts different aspects of English  culture to me.
I am constantly amused!
If y'all would only cheer at  marathons...!
