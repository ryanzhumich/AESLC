Cathy Van Way called asking my view on some names she'd been given to invite  to the hearing.
(I continue to cajole Jessie Knight to appear.)
During the  call, she mentioned that the committee intends to invite Steve Kean and that  she needed someone to email here Steve's vitals so that they could write a  letter inviting him.
