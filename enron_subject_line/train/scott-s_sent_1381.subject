Lia Hernandez, currently of ET&S, has accepted a position at ENA effective  August 2, 2000.
To ensure that ET&S continues to be in compliance with the  marketing affiliate rules, Lia's access to any ET&S or GPG-related LANs or  applications should be removed at the close of business on August 1.
In  addition, Lia's email profile should be changed and any GPG or ET&S mass  distribution  lists should be changed.
Please send a reply email to me after these changes have been completed,  verifying and indicating the date that employee was: - removed from the LAN - EBB password was changed/canceled (if applicable) - removed from ET&S or GPG-related applications - email post office box was transfered.
If you have questions, or if you believe there is someone else I need to  contact in order to accomplish the above, please let me know.
