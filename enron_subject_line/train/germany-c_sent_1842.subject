I forgot to tell you - I tried to call you from my cellular when I was coming  back from Jerry's yesterday.
I kept getting a message like "We're sorry,  this number does not accept calls from unidentified numbers"  or something  like that.
I had that same problem with Mr. Homco's home phone number a  couple of weeks ago.
