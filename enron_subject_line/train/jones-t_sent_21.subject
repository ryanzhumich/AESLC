Mark Taylor is going the be the host of the next ECT Legal Conference to be  held in the Woodlands in October and he asked me to contact you to see if you  know yet which of the Brits are going to be attending because we need to  start making reservations.
If you get a minute and can drop me a line I'd  appreciate it.
Thanks!
