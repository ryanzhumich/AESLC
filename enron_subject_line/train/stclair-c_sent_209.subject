David and Louise: I am working with Bob on a confidentiality agreement with Organic Inc. which  contains a mutual "no solicitation" provisions that would prevent either  party from hiring or soliciting for employment any employee or independent  contractor of the other for a period that would expire 6 months after the  termination of any business relationship of the parties.
How do you feel  about this?
Carol
