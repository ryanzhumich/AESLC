Ben noticed a mistake in the ABB contract - one I missed.
Enron's address  was listed as 1400 Louisiana.
I could not figure out where that address came  from, as it had been correct before.
I asked Kathy and she told me that she  changed it from Smith to Louisiana because she thought that was the correct  address.
Ok, now I'm scared.
