The previous two nights I have attempted to split out the Positions and P&L  as we discussed.
I now feel confident in the Positions part of this process  (Mike's swaps in the Exotic book,  new blotters, etc.).
The P&L portion of  the process has been significantly more difficult, but after working through  last night , I will have the P&L completely split out by the end of today.
Thanks for your help & patience,  Errol
