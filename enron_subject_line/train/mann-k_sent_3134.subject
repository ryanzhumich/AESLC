I have a change in plans next week.
My dad is having surgery in Ft. Worth,  so I will be heading that way on Monday.
I was planning to be on vacation  anyway, but I may have some accessibility challenges in Ft. Worth which I  would not have had otherwise.
I will manage client expectations accordingly.
