Hi Dan,  One more thing I want to mention.
As you know, Enron has a confidentiality  agreement with a competitor of Fuel Cell (I believe it is ONSI).
The  agreement has an exclusivity arrangement, which prevents the other company  from chasing certain transactions without Enron.
Once we really know what we  are going to do with FCE, will it be necessary/advisable to waive the  exclusivity provision to avoid any restraint of trade arguments?
FYI, When I last discussed the other company with Ozzie and Heather on  Friday, they were planning on calling the other company to tell them the  general status without violating confidentiality obligations to FCE or CRRA.
I will follow up to get the details of the discussion.
Kay
