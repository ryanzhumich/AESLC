The above counterparty has been created in the Financial Trading Agreements  Database and is listed as a master swap agreement, and it's not.
It is an  Electronic Trading Agreement and needs to be moved down to "Other  Agreements".
Please let me know when that is done and I will delete the  entry in  the master swap agreement database.
Thanks!
