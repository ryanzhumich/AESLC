It is nice to see that Pat Oxford came through again.
The real question is  :did Pat not support Bruce or does he have plenty of access but no influence  w/ the future president.
Maybe this says alot for Bush.
He thinks Pat is as  much of a cartoon character as we do and has no reason to  take him  seriously.
Wouldn't that be refreshing.
You need to get the real scoop before  lunch on Tuesday w/ Ileana.
