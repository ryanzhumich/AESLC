I was a little dismayed after our lunch when you disclosed the number of  broadband masters potentially close to signature.
However, I was a little  cheered up when I got back and checked with the Swap Group and found out we  have 13 masters out for signatures right now.
It still may be hard to beat  you at your going rate...but, all I have to say is we're still in the  game...GO TEAM!!
