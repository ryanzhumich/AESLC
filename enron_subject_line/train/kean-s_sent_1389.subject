Ken talked to Sen Kinder.
He made the points you had prepared.
Kinder  agreed to shelve the legislation for this session.
He said he had been  hearing from several others, including Proctor and Gamble (which has a big  facility in his district) that the legislation was not going to help  competition develop in the state.
He expressed willingness to work with us  on a better package and also expressed interest in coming to Enron's  offices.
He is going to be in San Antonio in August and would like to come  to Houston around that time.
