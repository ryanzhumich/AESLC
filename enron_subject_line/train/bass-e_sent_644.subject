Celeste,  I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the  program affect my eligibility for promotion.
At the end of last year you  informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid  year review (my 2 year anniversary).
It was my impression that the only  reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was  tenure.
Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible  for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.
I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this  PRC?
Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.
