Attached are my comments to the TBI proposal.
Please review and let me know  if you have any comments.
I also wanted to clarify a point on the Tom Brown form of gathering  agreement.
The revised form is an interruptible agreement with no acreage  dedication.
Since Tom Brown removed all the acreage dedication language, it  is my understanding that they were not willing to give us an acreage  dedication.
To the extent we modeled our economics on any Tom Brown  production, I wanted to make sure everyone understands that these volumes are  not committed to the system we are purchasing and can be taken by Tom Brown  to someone else at their discretion.
