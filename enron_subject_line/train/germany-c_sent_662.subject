Per my discussion with Marde yesterday afternoon - EES is set up to serve  CanFibre.
However, National Fuel Gas Distribution (the LDC) will not let any  gas flow until CanFibre gets a corporate guarantee in place.
Per Marde,  CanFibre is working on getting a guarantee.
OK - I'm tossing all my info on CanFibre.
