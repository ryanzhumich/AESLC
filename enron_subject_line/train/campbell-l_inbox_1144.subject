The Environmental Affairs Department is developing a list of ETS natural gas pipeline facilities where the  condensate throughput exceeds 30,000 gallons/year.
In the coming weeks, the Division Environmental Specialists will be asking your operating teams for annual condensate throughput at all facilities.
Please impress upon the teams the importance of collecting and providing this information as we have committed to a first quarter 2002 deadline to compile the list.
This request is especially critical in areas prior to processing as the likelihood of the annual condensate throughput to exceed 30,000 gallons/year increases in those areas.
Please  call me at (402) 398-7716 or email me if you have any questions about this request.
Thank you for your help!
Ruth Jensen Manager, Air Programs
