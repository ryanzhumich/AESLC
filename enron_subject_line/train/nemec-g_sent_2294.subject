Heather,  Attached are redlines of both the Coal Handling Agreement and the  Ash Handling Agreement with revisions.
I made a few further changes to the  Ash Handling Agreement in the Indemnity Section.
Please review and let me  know if you have any questions.
Both docs do have a few questions inserted  where I wasn't sure if the language accurately reflected our deal.
Sorry for  the delay.
