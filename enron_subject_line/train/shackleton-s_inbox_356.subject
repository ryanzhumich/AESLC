Sara!
We are ok with eliminating the CSA from the ISDA with Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC).
However, we would like to add an additional termination event, of debt rating change below A for OUC and BBB- for Enron Corp.  Richard!
In the absence of any margin rights, we will be monitoring trading activities with this counterparty more closely and this may result in certain transactions limitations.
