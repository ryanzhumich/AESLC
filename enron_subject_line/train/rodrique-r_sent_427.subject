Debbie,  Thank you for returning my call.
I went to the eRequest to submit a request  for Risktrac but the only option was to get access to the application.
I  already have the application I merely need access to the VAR module.
Therefore, I did not submit an eRequest.
Please let me know what I need to  submit to ensure I get the proper access.
Thank you,
