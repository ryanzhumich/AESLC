I left you a voicemail yesterday about getting a master in place with  Anadarko located here in Houston so they can trade Brent Crude and IPE  lookalikes on EnronOnline under a master instead of a GTC.
We have an ISDA  in place with Anadarko, but since ECTRIC is the counterparty online for those  products, the trades wouldn't go under the ENA master.
The trader is  pestering me about this.
What I would like to do is handle getting this ISDA in place with ECTRIC here  in Houston, if that's OK with you, just mirroring the US master (except  getting a Multicurrency in place since we have a Local Currency in place with  ENA).
Is that OK with you?
