Just a thought:  I'm assuming it will be too difficult to build in customized  credit provisions on a counterparty by counterparty basis on-line - but if  there are master agreements in place, the  credit provisions contained in  them would apply to on-line trades.
The availability of the on-line system  may therefore encourage more master agreements since the Credit Dept.
will  limit a counterparty's trading volume until credit terms can be imposed.
