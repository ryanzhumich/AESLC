Dear Mr.
Dune,  At the request of Dovie Keprta, I am enclosing our proposed form of  Non-Disclosure Agreement.
I have also enclosed a blacklined draft showing  the changes from the NDA you executed with Enron Broadband.
If the enclosed  meets with your approval, please have an authorized officer execute two  copies and return them to me for execution by Enron.
If you have any  comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399.
