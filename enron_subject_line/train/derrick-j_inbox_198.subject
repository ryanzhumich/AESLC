Jim, as we discussed late last night I checked with all folks in the DC office who would have any conceivable reason to talk to Treasury.
No one had a conversation yesterday where the SEC issue was discussed.
Today, I have checked with the remainder of the DC office, and no one has had such a conversation.
I hope this is helpful.
