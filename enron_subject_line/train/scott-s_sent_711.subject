Hey Darren,  I haven't forgotten that I still owe you a birthday beer.
In fact, Ted was  kind enough to point out my failure to do so and add to my already heavy  feelings of guilt.
Anyway, I know you guys are working hard getting your  presentation ready, but if you need a break I'm planning on meeting a friend  at Kenneally's tonight for a little pizza and beer.
Let me know if you have  any interest in collecting...if not, you can just hold on to your raincheck  until another time.
Susan
