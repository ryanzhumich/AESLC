Hi Lisa: Just got a call from Rick.
He said that 1) The meeting needs to be in San  Francisco.
2) The meeting needs to be on Dec. 5th.
(Not the 29th or the 30th,  as previously requested).
3) The meeting is mandatory.
I'll leave a message  for Paul, too.
If you have any questions, just give a ring.
Best,
