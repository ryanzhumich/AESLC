I am familiar with one active case and one threatened litigation involving  the companies on the Investment Portfolio list.
Steel Dynamics has been sued  for securities fraud involving the NSM transaction.
Cgas has been threatened  with litigation by Jerry Jordan, the former CEO.
Jerry Jordan disagrees with  Cgas' evaluation of the stock he retained (which is subject to a buyout  provision).
We think it is worth +/- 500,000.
He thinks it is worth +/- 1.5  million.
