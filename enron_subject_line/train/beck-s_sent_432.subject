I didn't know that you were talking to Jennifer.
I had put her on the list  of attendees at last Thursday's meeting with Tom Gros.
He had asked about  someone being included that had been involved with Enron Online, I felt that  she might be perfect to be involved in Networks with her exposure to EOL.
I  don't know whether or not you realized that she was in the room for that  conference call.
What is she going to do for you in gas?
We may be  hardpressed to find another strong candidate for the Networks project who has  been as involved with EOL.
