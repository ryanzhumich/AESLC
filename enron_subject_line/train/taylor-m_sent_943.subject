I realized after I had sent the Koch confirmation to you (but before I faxed  it to Koch) that I might have given too much away by using the Effective Date  as the Buyer Payment Date.
In the version I send to Koch I will change that  to Trade Date.
You can always change it to a later date if you want to  tomorrow.
