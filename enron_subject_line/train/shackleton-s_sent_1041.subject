Greetings to you both!
It has been awhile since we last spoke.
I would like  to finalize the matrix which we have been discussing since the latter part of  1999.
Although we were awaiting new Central Bank regulations, I am beginning  to think that the Central Bank revisions will not impact the matrix except  with respect to transactions which may be entered into by entities that are  the subject of the Central Bank regulations.
Please let me know whether or  not you agree or can offer any suggestions.
Thanks and regards.
Sara
