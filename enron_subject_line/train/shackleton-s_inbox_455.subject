sara, as discussed attached is a cleaned up redlined version of the schedule.
as you know, there are still several open issues, but hopefully, it will be easier to work from this document.
in the meantime, i will work on redlining the csa and reviewing some of the open issues in the schedule that are in my court.
thanks for your help and have a great weekend!
