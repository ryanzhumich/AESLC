Your recent voice mail message to me indicated that you maintain a list of  board positions held by VP's and above.
I thought that it might be helpful  to have this in writing to add to your list.
Beginning with a fiscal year  that starts April 2001, I am now a member of the Board and President-Elect of  National Charity League, a mother-daughter community volunteer organization.
We have over 300 members, including mothers and their daughters in grades 7  through 12, in the Spring/Champions area.
We run bingo games in local  nursing homes, provide "coaching" during practices for Special Olympics  volleyball, tennis, track and bowling, stock local food pantries, work with  children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools, etc.
It  is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a  focus on others, at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only  on themselves.
The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will  remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment.
