Gerald,  We are in discussion with Public Service Company of Colorado about acquiring a small gathering system just north of the Badger Wash Gas Plant.
The attached document gives a little background of the transaction and lists some of my questions concerning this transaction.
After you review the document, I would like to discuss these issues with you to be sure we have addressed all Crescendo's risks and obligations.
Thanks,
