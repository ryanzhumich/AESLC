Christie,  I have two persons in my group helping me with the Wharton and Rice projects.
By the way, the project I gave to Rice students is exactly the same as the project for Wharton.
We shall see who is better.
Their names are Li Sun  and Kenneth Parkhill.
Can we invite them to the dinner on the 18th and to the meetings on Friday?
Vince
