Teb - I've been meaning to tell you about a couple of appointments.
Mom has her last follow-up visit concerning her surgery this Friday at 11.
I would like to take off the entire day, but if that won't work I can come in for the afternoon.
Also, she has another appointment on Monday at 3:15 in Sugarland.
I will need to take a good chunk of the afternoon off on Monday.
Thank you in advance for always being so understanding.
