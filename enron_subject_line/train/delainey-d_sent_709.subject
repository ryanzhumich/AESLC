David, I'm not sure there is any value to this for EES North America.
There  are well known and documented controls and process issues in the mid, back  and risk offices of the company.
We are working quickly to rectify  -  servicing your needs at the same time would slow us down.
On the European  side, I would like your perspective on their controls and business.
Regards
