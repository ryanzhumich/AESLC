If you have not logged onto the PEP system to designate reviewers, or  approve reviewers for those in your organization, please do so today.
The deadline for completing performance evaluation information is November  17.
The performance review process is critical to year-end evaluations and  bonus, promotion and compensation decisions.
This year, as in previous review  periods, the system enables "360 degree" feedback throughout the organization.
Please take some time today to get the process started.
