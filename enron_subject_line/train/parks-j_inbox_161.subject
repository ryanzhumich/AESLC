Last week, several Enron employees participated in a roundtable discussion for National Public Radio's Marketplace.
The discussion, which focused on working at Enron today and the company's efforts to reorganize, was positive and upbeat.
In Houston, the segment is scheduled to run tonight, April 29 at 6:30 p.m. CST on KUHF 88.7 FM.
Employees outside of Houston should check their local NPR listing for Marketplace air times.
The segment also will be available later today on NPR's website: www.npr.org.
