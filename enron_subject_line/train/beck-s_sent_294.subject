If you absolutely can not find enough of the right players to go on the  cruise, let me know.
My husband is scheduled for a baseball game on  Wednesday night.
If I could find some Diamond level tickets for another day  for him, he might consider giving up his tickets for Wednesday night.
This  is a last resort sort of measure, however, so I hope that you find success in  response from others.
But do let me know...
