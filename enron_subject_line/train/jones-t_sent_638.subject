Attached please find the referenced list.
Some additional comments are as  follows:  1.
City of Redding-no change from our previous approvals.
2.
Cajun Electric Power-no west coast power (caiso or firm).
It can only  trade east coast power and Enron can only purchase from Cajun via EOL.
As usual, no European power until further notice.
