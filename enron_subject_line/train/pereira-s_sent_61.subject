Hi, Elise.
Sorry to bother you, but when Kali was unwrapping her presents  last night, there were two without cards or tags (probably lost in  transit!!).
We narrowed it down to Laura and Sofi.
So that we can get the  thank you notes correct, did Laura give Kali  a Skipper doll or a bath set in  a blue bag?
Thanks for your help.
