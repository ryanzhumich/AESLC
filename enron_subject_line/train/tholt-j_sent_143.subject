I am coming in on a United Flight 7954 that leaves LA at 3:15 and arrives San  Diego at 4:04.
Staying at theHyatt Islandia in Mission Bay.
Look forward to  seeing you even if it is for a short time.
I'm leaving for Vail tomorrow  afternoon-so if you have any questions I'll get back to you on Monday.
