I've reviewed the IGS market development agreement pursuant to your request.
It expires 2/29/00.
The agreement requires the parties to meet 90 days prior  to that date for the purpose of discussing an extension but does not obligate  us to agree to any such extension.
As you know, I have a conflict tomorrow at 10, but would be happy to provide  any other information you need for the meeting.
