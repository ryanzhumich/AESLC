I will be in Dallas from Tuesday, August 29 through Thursday, August 31 at an  offsite session hosted by Rick Causey to review the SAP implementation and  next steps.
The linkage of Unify and our Global Databases to SAP is a  critical one, and decisions around next steps can impact these operating  systems and our processes.
Therefore, Rick has asked that I attend.
