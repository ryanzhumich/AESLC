I sent down the list for 9/27/00 on Friday.
On the 9/26/00 list, for Edison  Mission Marketing & Trade, I am showing them as "amended-no change" becuase I  already had them open for emissions.
Same on FPL Energy Power Marketing, I  am showing them as "amended-no change" because I already had them opened for  physical gas.
