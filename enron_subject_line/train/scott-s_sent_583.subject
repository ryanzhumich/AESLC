Hey guys,  Well I'm back home in Houston looking out at our lovely skyline (okay, maybe  it's not that lovely but it is sunny here).
Anyway, I'm so glad I got the  chance to see all of you while I was in London.
It seemed as though all of  you are really enjoying your time in the UK - which is good to hear given the  fact I'm hoping to make it over there myself.
Hope the approaching close to  2000 finds everyone in good spirits.
Cheers,

Home safe and sound
