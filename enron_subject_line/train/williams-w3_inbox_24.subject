Bill,  Everything went smooth last night and this morning with El Paso and the ramps.
Due to the migration I am unable to send the EPE model to Kathy (file for Feb. did not pull into the M: drive).
I was also unable to get into CAPS (Trading cluster is not reconfigured).
I saved the model through my shift and now that I have logged off I am unable to log back on under my name.
I updated Geir's login last night (upon his request) and have limited access through his login.
Holden is aware of these problems.
