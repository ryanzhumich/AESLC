In a recent discussion with Mark H, he suggested that I consult you two  gentlemen about outside counsel in Chicago to support our efforts with  Peoples.
It would be beneficial to have a firm on board with some trading  expertise, as well as more generalized transactional experience.
Gas would  be a plus.
I've used Jones, Day  (good job on regulatory issues), and Piper Rudnick (bad  experience).
Any suggestions?
Thanks,
