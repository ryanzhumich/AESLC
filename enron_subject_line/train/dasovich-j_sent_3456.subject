Here is the final version.
I'll bring copies with me tomorrow to Sacramento  and can drop them off at Hedy's office.
I meet with Kari Dohn at 10 AM and  will be attending the AB 1890 Implementation Group meeting at 1:30.
I can  drop off copies before I head out for the Dohn meeting.
If there's anything  else, just let me know.
Thanks.
Best,
