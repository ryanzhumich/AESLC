As we all know, the TBS/Enron South America LLC ("ESA") confirmation issue is  draining our little brains.
Let's all conference sometime Monday to sort  through how these trades should be documented, booked and otherwise handled.
Lynn has suggested that ESA is merely a holding company and therefore, an  inappropriate vehicle for holding trades (maybe one or two trades is O.K.).
Also, any ESA documents must be executed in the U.S.  Brent:  please leave me a voice or email for convenient times.
