With the cancellation of a number of Surety Bonds by our providers, we are faced with a potential credit crunch in NEPOOL.
Also, it is my understanding (although I haven't seen anything) that our Nov 2001 bills are due in all of the markets on Dec 20, 2001.
Christi and I are trying to work out our payment plans (if any) and other requirements to keep our books afloat.
We need to have support on understanding any payment obligations (and bills if we have them) and issues (e.g., Annual Fees).
Who can we talk with for each market?
Thanks,
