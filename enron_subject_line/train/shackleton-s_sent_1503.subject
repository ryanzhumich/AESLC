Carol:  Here's my "short" list of issues for Mark:  (1)  Swap Group Meeting on Wednesday, June 7:  (a) reiterate "rules" (e.g., office hours, taking personal/vacation time and  advising the rest of the group, how rotation of masters/confirms/C.A.
works  and   what happens when someone is ill/vacation, timeliness of deemed  ISDA's/omnibus confirms, confirmation desk, etc.)
(b)paralegal workload  (2)  Confirmations and need to create a "writing"  multiple confirms with the same counterparty   confirms with extremely short terms (hourly, under 5 days) - no confirm?
use of confirms with negative language  (3)  Hiring a clerk to assist paralegals to run errands  (4)  Policy regarding INDIVIDUALS as eligible swap participants  (5)  Method for shortening weather confirms  (6)  Mary and Brent - possible work assignments
