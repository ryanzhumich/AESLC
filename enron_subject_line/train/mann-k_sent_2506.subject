At this time it appears that I will be going to NYC on Wednesday, returning  Friday afternoon or possibly Thursday night.
I'll miss the Turbopark closing  dinner, which is not all bad, as it will save me a lot of calories and a  headache.
I will miss getting the pat on the back.
I didn't want to miss  Michael's open house, though, as that was more important.
As you know, things are subjec to change.
