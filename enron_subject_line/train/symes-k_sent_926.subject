Will -   I've passed your phone number along to Bill Williams, the Real Time group  manager here in Portland.
He should be contacting you shortly to discuss  problems with and changes to the Scheduling Activity Report.
I've checked  with other groups on the floor and found that the report is only used by Real  Time, and less frequently by groups assisting Real Time, so I believe Bill or  someone in his group could most suitably test the new application.
Let me  know if there's anything else I can do, and thanks for all your help today.
Kate
