The Moorings people asked me to call back tomorrow when they'll have a better  idea about the storm situation - they canceled all of their charter starts  for today & tomorrow (no surprise) and she expected Thursday's to cancel  also.
They still have everything for the weekend scheduled to go out but  they weren't supposed to confirm any hotel rooms between now and Saturday.
They were able to confirm a room for you for Sunday the 28th (the day we have  to bring the boat back).
I'll let you know what happens when I get through  to them tomorrow.
