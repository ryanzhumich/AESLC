Attached are my calculations of the IF volumes for CGAS.
I will also try to  update this schedule for the AGL production area volumes.
I have also included the CGAS NX1 deals.
I feel good about the NX1 volumes  for Jan and Feb, I not sure about the Mar forward volumes yet.
I will keep  working on thei sheet.
