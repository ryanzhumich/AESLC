I am contacting you on the recommendation of Pug Winokur, who is on our Board  of Directors.
Enron has formed an Advisory Council which consists of  academicians, public policy thinkers and media, together with Enron  executives.
I would like to invite you to address the group on E-Commerce  issues at our next meeting  (Friday, September 8th in Houston).
Attached is a list of our Advisory Council members.
