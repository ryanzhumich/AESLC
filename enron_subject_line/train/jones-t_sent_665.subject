San Diego has applied for a Password Application and wants to trade  financial.
Per them, they have already been trading financial off-line with  us, and I check with the Confirm Desk and that statement is true, Craig  Breslau has done financial trades with them (I thought they weren't allowed  to trade financial?!).
Anyway, can we now open them up to trade financial?
