On or about 5/2/01we opened the above counterparty to transact Canadian/US  Currency Swaps on EnronOnline (which they cannot transact under the old  Master Energy Price Swap Agreement, they would have to transact udner the  GTC).
After discussing this counterparty w/Sara Shackleton, an attorney in  the swap group, it appears that Sara has been talking to Morgan Stanley and  Morgan Stanley does all its interest rate & currency business out of Morgan  Stanley Capital Services, Inc.  We can keep Morgan Stanley Capital Group open  for currency swaps, but if they don't trade currency swaps out of that  company we'll know why.
Sara is already working on an ISDA Master for  Capital Services for Gary Hickerson's group.
