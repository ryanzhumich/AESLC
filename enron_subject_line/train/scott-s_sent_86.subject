Hi Lindy.
Sorry I've not yet set up the meeting on imbalances...I feel I am  still lacking focus so thought I'd run this by you for your comments before  inviting people.
First of all, I believe the general topics we wanted to address were:  - imbalance netting & trading - mandatory use of Park N Ride service for out of balance operators - hourly determination of imbalances  Is this correct?
Next, the list of attendees:  you, me, Darrell, Richard Hanagriff, Sheila  Nacey (or someone else she designates).
Anyone else?
As far as timing, I am very flexible, so let me know what works for you, and  I'll get it set up.
