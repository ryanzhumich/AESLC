A meeting was held with the third party attorney who is providing assistance  with the recently issued NOV for the P-1 C/S over a like for like turbine  exchange which occurred in 1996.
A history was given of the incidents which  led up to the NOV being issued and results of the meeting which Transwestern  had with the AQB in 1996 which lead Transwestern to believe that issue had  been resolved.
The calendar year 2000 PCB annual document logs were prepared and submitted  to each generator of PCBs on the Transwestern system.
Training was given to the Midland Region over the correct completion and  submittal of forms used to report natural gas releases  to the TNRCC.
The  agency has updated and has become more stringent with respect to Regional  requirements for the reportable releases which are submitted to them.
An  incomplete form submittal by a compressor station facility near MIdland led  to this emergency training being given.
Based upon a phone call with Region  7 of the TNRCC, the agency stated that they will be issuing NOV's to  facilities that submit incomplete "Upset/Maintenance NOtification Forms for  Reportable Events".
