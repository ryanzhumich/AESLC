The agenda I'm trying to put together for the next meeting will include the  customary presentations from Davies/Lindsay and Kristol as well as the energy  policy discussion we are looking for from you and Bob.
We will also be updating the council on Enron Networks - - a business unit  formed to extend Enron's business model to other industries (especially  commodities or "commoditzable" goods).
Most recently we have extended into  metals, expanded our presence in paper, and begun an examination of  agricultural commodities.
I'd like your help in identifying a guest  participant who may help us think through some of the issues from either (or  both) of two perspectives:  business strategy:  what markets are candidates for commoditization.
(I have  asked Gary Hamel to consider this topic as well).
public policy:  as more businesses adopt online business models (like  exchanges), as more goods are bought and sold like commodities, and as more  transactions move off the traditional regulated exchanges, how are policy  makers (SEC, FTC, CFTC and their overseas counterparts) likely to react?
