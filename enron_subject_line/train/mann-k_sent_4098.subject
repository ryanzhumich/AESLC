I took a crack at tightening up the E Next assignment language as it exists  in the overrides, for inclusion in WH form:    Peter, could you take first cut at the override letter?
We  may be having an  internal meeting at 930 central, and if so, will you be available by phone if  necessary?
Suz, please put the attachment in the notebook.
Thanks,
