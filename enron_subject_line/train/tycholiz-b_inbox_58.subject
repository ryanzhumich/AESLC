I was advised by Lad Lorenz of Socal that their original application sets forth the plan by which they will sell the residual gas in the Montebello storage field.
Can you please advise me of the final tems of the PUC decision (should have been announced yesterday) and get a copy of the application?
Based upon yesterday's conference in D.C., I  think the restructuring of Socal's backbone transportation is about to become a hot topic again!
Please keep us apprised.
