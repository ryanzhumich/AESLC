Guys, can you put together the folllowing Portfolio/Charter Review for  Principal Investing and Energy Capital Resources:  a) detail existing portfolio - winners/losers; additions/deletions and  overall performance;  b) detail market conditions in your markets and any strategy changes  following;  c) anticipated major transactions in 2001; and  d) review charter and detail any proposed changes.
