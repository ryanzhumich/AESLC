I read the applications, letters of recommendation and resumes on the plane  to Austin and in the hospital this weekend.
Below are my suggested seven  appointees to the Analyst Advisory Board.
I made the selections based on  their answers to the application questions, plus I attended to get a mix of  male and female, commercial and merchant service analysts rotations, current  operating company assignments, undergraduate schools, etc.
I am sorry that I will not be able to join you in the meeting today.
