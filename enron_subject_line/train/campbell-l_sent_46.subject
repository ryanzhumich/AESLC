Just a short note to let you know that I received a call from Rod Bosche of  PG&E apprising me of a meeting PG&E will be having with SW Gas this tuesday.
They will be discussing PCB issues and the sampling results from the PG&E  system.
From discussions with Louie, a media statement is being prepared by  them which Louie has a copy of.
The statement is a little harsh and makes  some statements which are incorrect.
Louie and I are planning to attend this  meeting in Las Vegas to possibly assist in making some suggestions about  rewording their statement and provide some additional insight and history on  the Transwestern system with respect to PCB's.
The results of this meeting  will be forwarded at a later date.....
