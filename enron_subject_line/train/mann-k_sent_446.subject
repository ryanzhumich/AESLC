Gorman's will be picking up/delivering on Tues/Fri.
They had Mon/Thurs  available, but Monday am is too hard to remember.
Besides, Delmis may be  able to bring our clothes in on Tuesdays, and I'm generally home early on  Friday.
Our driver's name is David.
His cell phone is 713 545 4186.
We can call him  if we ever need pick up/delivery on a different day.
He will leave us a sack today.
How's that for cool?
