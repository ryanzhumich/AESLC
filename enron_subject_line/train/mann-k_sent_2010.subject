It won't hurt my feelings if you want to contact ABB's lawyer directly.
His  name is Dave Onuscheck, and his email is david.onuscheck@us.abb.com.
I'm  home with a sick kid, and I don't have his telephone number with me.
Peter Thompson has worked on the form.
Do you have the draft with the memo  of issues?
