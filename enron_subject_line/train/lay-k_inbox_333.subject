Dear Enron's topmanagement, We are not only concerned on the crashed stock but also Enron's situation in Japan.
The business here is too difficult!!!
How do you know the current situation here:    > Bad Reputation in Japan - if you say you are from Enron people will say "No"   > Ignorance of Japanese Business - wasting many time on TOCOM, a market     controlled by mafia, those minor comnies want to cheat Enron's money   > Unsatisfactory business environment - deregulation will not proceed in three     years   > Poor manegment - the office is like a kindergarden, the so called "experts"     have serious discrimmination with local staff; They do nothing themselves just     ask the local "slave" to work hard and they go to vacation or business trip   > "Sato" means sweet in Japanese but Sato Project is not so sweet as you think!
Have you expected another "E-power"?
I have to say we are so dispointed with Enron!!!!
Enron Japan is at the entrance of "Bermuda Triangle", we worry when will it dispear?
