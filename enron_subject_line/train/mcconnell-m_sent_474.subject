Jeff,   Sorry for the slow response.
I don't have a strong opinion either way.
I am fine with the combo idea.
In the future, please let me know if something has a short fuse.
I am still  slower on email but I do respond very quickly to voicemail.
I am almost  caught up on back log emails but this will probably never by my first and  best way to communcate.
