Rod and Susan:  The CP's lawyer asked for a new draft so we can redraft on  our new form.
Unless Rod objects, we will use the same credit.
Rod, there  will be  cross default  and transferability issues (check Lotus Notes) but we  can discuss when CP returns comments.
Our Portland trader is Kim Ward and  she would like to be copied on the redraft.
Thanks.
Sara
