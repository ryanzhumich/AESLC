Vince,   1) Did you talk to Whalley about Christian Werner?
I am sure that the is going to be calling in the next few days, and will want to know the status of his employment with Enron.
2) As you know Stephen Bennett would like to go to Rice's Executive MBA program.
In light of everything that is going on, do you still want to fund this?
The cost is 65K for two years, and we will need to submit a letter of nomination on Enron letterhead signed by a senior exec agreeing to do the following: 1) provide full financial support for the nominee, payable at the beginning of each academic year, and 2) Schedule the Nominee's work and travel requirements to permit regular class attendance, including the international trip, and completion of class assignments.
Steve would like to attend in the fall, and app's are due in the beginning of 2002, so we just need to work on this, if you agree to pay for it.
Thanks,
