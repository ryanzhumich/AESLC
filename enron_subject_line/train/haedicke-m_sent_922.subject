I am responding on behalf of Mark Haedicke.
We have checked with our  department and our lawyers are not aware of any such contracts as you  described in your e-mail.
Barbara Gray responded, "I am unaware of any subcontracts for this period.
I  do know that we have used minority lawyers, but that does not appear to be  responsive to the question."
Thank you.
