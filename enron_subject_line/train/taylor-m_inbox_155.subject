Mark  I have an e-mail with an attachment that I cannot forward to you because it is coded in  Lotus notes as Personal and Confidential.
It is from  Kim Humbarger and the  Subject line is:   Electronic Signatures on Enron Direct Mass Market Agreements.
I presume you just want me to delete the memo and you will get an original from Kim.
