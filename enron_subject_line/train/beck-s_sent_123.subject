I believe that all of you have met Frank (whose last name I can't remember),  the HR generalist who is currently working with Hector to serve the HR needs  for Energy Operations in ENA.
Frank is working on a contract basis at this  time, and Sheila Walton is seeking feedback on his performance to date in  order to evaluate the duration of his work as a contractor and the  feasibility of bringing him in as an employee.
I have given Sheila my  feedback, but suggested to her that you may have had more contact with Frank  than I have had.
Please take the time to send Sheila an e:mail message or  voice mail to let her know what your experiences have been in working with  Frank.
Your input will be very valuable to Sheila.
Thanks for taking the  time to do this.
