Attached is the resume of Dominic Carolan, who currently is working at Global  E&P.
He is looking to move elsewhere within Enron, given that the assets in  Global E&P are going to be sold.
I understand that you are looking for a lawyer with oil and gas experience.
He might be a good candidate.
I met him today, and he is pleasant and  professional.
If you are interested in interviewing him, let me know, and I will get it  scheduled.
Thanks.
Michelle
