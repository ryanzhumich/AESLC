Terry: Just wanted to let you know that our son, Charles Eugene, was born on July  12th.
He is absolutely beautiful and well worth the long wait and all of the  time and effort that it took to have him.
After a prolonged stay in the  hospital, we are both home now and doing really well.
I'm on cloud nine and  I'm sure that all of this will hit me soon.
Hope you are doing well.
Take  care.
