We are in the process of filing our annual hedge exemptions with the NYMEX  for 1999.
In connection therewith, I will need to provide the NYMEX with an  updated copy of the alphabetical list of Enron Corp. and Subsidiary  Companies.
My last list was dated June 8, 1998.
Thanks Kate, as usual, for your help!
