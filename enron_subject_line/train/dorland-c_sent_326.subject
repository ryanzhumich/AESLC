We are going to have a meeting to discuss S/D in Alberta and the west  Wednesday at 3:30 in the computer training room downstairs.
The focus of the  meeting will be to fine tune our very rough summer forecast for the "X" (NWP  Sumas to La Plata B and PGT Kingsgate to Malin).
Everyone is welcome.
Free hotdogs and donuts for the first 100 customers!
Bring the kids, we've got fun for the whole family.
Chris
