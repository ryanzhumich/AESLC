Stacy,  Jeff asked me to pass this on to you for handling:  Tom Nuelle (pronounced "Nelly"), Risk Manager at BP Amoco called, and said  they need to assign a physical trade from one Amoco entity to another.
The  trade was done w/Amoco Energy Trading and they need to assign it to Amoco  Canada.
It's a Nov-March,EOL Deal no.
265080.
Tom's phone # is  281/366-4034.
Tom Moran from Credit had no problem moving the trade.
