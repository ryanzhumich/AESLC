We will be short in Real Time Position Manager both at NP-15 and SP-15 for  1/18/01 until Friday morning.
It seems that four deals were entered by EES  under the wrong desk, affecting our position instead of theirs.
Following are  the details of where, when, why and by how much we're out.
Read this  carefully....  SP-15 - Short 1950.64 MW  Deal #500492 - 67.89 MW short off peak  Deal #500493 - 87.97 MW short on peak  NP-15 - Short 2883.08 MW  Deal #500494 - 102.61 MW short off peak  Deal #500495 - 128.89 MW short on peak  If any one of you has better luck than I have at accessing EES deals in deal  entry, by all means get rid of these.
Or if you happen to speak with Suneet  Sharma, our good friend who entered the deals in question, by all means tell  him to do the same.
Thanks,
