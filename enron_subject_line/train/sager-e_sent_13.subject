Hi Susan  How's things going?
I hope at least OK if not well.
Delete my rambling voice mail if you haven't heard it .
Hey about the Sat party, I'm thrilled.
We would, of course, love to come to  your house (I think Gail told me that you generously offered to host your own  birthday party) but we would also love to have you guys at our house as well  (wouldn't you rather relax, drink and let the kids shuffle around without  having to worry about the diner preparation, and worse yet, clean up - after  all it is your party - mine's next).
Let me know what you think.
Sager
