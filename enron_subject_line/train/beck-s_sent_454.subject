Hopefully  none of this is a surprise and the appropriate arrangements have been made  for desk, phone and computers for all.
Secondly, please make a point of seeking out these interns and welcoming them  to Enron.
Finally, after I know where these analysts are placed, we will have a brief  meeting with the analysts' managers and any of you under whom they will be  working to discuss ideas on making the analysts assignments meaningful this  summer.
I welcome ideas on this from any of you.
