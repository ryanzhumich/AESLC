I would like to exchange ideas on topics for the upcoming Enron Advisory  Council meeting.
The discussion you led last time was particularly thought  provoking and I'd like to extend an open-ended invitation for you to take the  floor again on a topic of your choice.
We will have presentations from Gavyn Davies and Larry Lindsay on  macroeconomic trends as well as the customary domestic political update from  Bill Kristol.
The balance of the meeting will focus on markets which are, or  could be, commoditized.
We will update the Council on new markets we've  added to the Enron portfolio through Enron Networks, (most recently metals  and paper).
A presentation by you on this, or another trend, would be most  welcome.
Let me know what you think.
