We are flying in on Thursday.
We plan on renting a car and driving to your  place.
I'll update you on specific times early next week.
Because me and  the kids are using reward miles for our tickets, right now Kristi is not on  the same flight that the three of us are on.
We are all looking forward to  seeing you.
