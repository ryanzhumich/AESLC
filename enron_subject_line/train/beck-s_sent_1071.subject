I understand from Shona that you and she have discussed our plans for  Doorstep Reviews in 2001.
I am asking via this note for my assistant to set  up a meeting for the two of us to spend some time reviewing the timeline,  methodology, Andersen's involvement and the involvement of your team.
I will  be on vacation the week of December 18.
I will be working the week between  Christmas and New Year's, so if you are in the office we can plan on getting  together that week.
