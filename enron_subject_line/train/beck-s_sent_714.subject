According to Tammy Shepperd who is very involved in space allocation for the  new building, a location for Sheri Thomas' Product Control Group remains up  in the air.
Sheri, Andy Zipper, John Cummings, and Surresh have met to  discuss space, and all agree that Sheri's group needs to be located with  their groups.
My understanding is that you have designated a certain number  of spaces for ENW on the trading floors, but that Sheri's group is not  included in that count.
Can we get together when you return to the office  next week and discuss floor space?
Thanks.
