In an effort to bring incremental revenue for our pipeline, I researched  outstanding invoices generated from facility interconnects, etc.
Transwestern currently has no outstanding dollars to collect.
However, there  appears to be $600,000 that can be collected on Northern Natural in addition  to $250,000 that was written off.
Attached are the spreadsheets from  Accounts Receivable.
