Hi Carlos,  Jake called and said he wants to sign up Delta tomorrow (Friday).
I had a  conference call with John, Carolyn and Rick Vincens, and we are pushing  forward.
If you read this, could you tell me about any critical issues.
Also, has there been a risk memo started, and has Accounting signed off on  the structure?
I'll get up to speed on this during the evening, and will take your deal toy  when the deal is done.
Kay
