I am planning to travel to Argentina and Brazil in the next 10 days.
Will  you be able to provide me with your written comments on the draft ISDA  Schedule by September 10?
Also, will you be in the BA office during the  period from September 13 through 25?
I will schedule a meeting with you as I  finalize plans.
Enron's office will be closed on Monday, September 6.
I look forward to  hearing from you after that date.
Regards.
Sara
