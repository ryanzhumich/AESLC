It currently appears that I will be on the road Wednesday and Thursday.
Figures!
I am going to send you a copy of the marked up interconnection agreement,  which has comments from various Enron people.
I thought it might help you  think about which way to head.
I would appreciate receiving an electronic file of the IC you prepared.
Talk to you soon,  Kay
