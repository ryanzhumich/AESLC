I have an early morning appointment on Tuesday and will be unable to join the  phone conference.
I don't have anything new to report.
I have rescheduled  the meeting with Tozzini in ESA's offices for Tuesday, Nov. 30 at 2 pm in  order to conference in the Houston attendees.
We will not require video  conferencing (but thanks for the offer).
Also, Lynn A. will have a final  assessment of tax issues relating to an Argentine trading office location and  we will try to meet with D. Black and/ or Michael G.   Lynn will provide with  his analysis beforehand.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Sara
