Sheri,  Robyn Menear is my new assistant on the FT-Central book.
I'd like to have  her set up to use EOL stack manager, product manager, and transact on the  website.
I believe she already has a login ID for the website, but I don't  know about the others.
In addition, her trades (stack manager customer  trades, and her own website trades) need to go into my book (FT-Central).
If  you need me to do anything else in order for this to happen, let me know.
Thanks,
