This is a gentle reminder, and Im sure that most are aware, but under no  circumstances is there to be any construction activiy initiated for the  turbine installation at the four mainline compressor stations, until the air  construction permits are issued by the applicable air agency.
Construction  activity is defined, but is not limited to roads, trenching activity,  buildings, electrical poles etc.
The state and federal agencies take a very  dim view on initiating any attempts to initiate construction prior to  approval.
This approval is considered to be the air permit authorizing  construction of the proposed activity.
Your assistance in this compliance  issue will be greatly apprecaited.
Data generation and agency consultations  are now in progress to expidite the permit submittals.
Should you need  further clarification, give me a call (505) 625-8022 or via e-mail.
