Susan: I hope to finalize the Master today on our conference call.
Could you please  start pulling together the ENA and Enron Corp certificates?
They are alos  requesting a W-9.
I would like to have all of these ready and executed by  this time next week.
I will send you the Enron Guaranty after it has been  finalized.
Thanks.
Call if you have any questions.
My contacts there are  Adele Raspe and Maria Salvatore, her legal assistant.
Carol
