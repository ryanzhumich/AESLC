Bob,  Here's the bill of sale we didn't use on the last deal.
I don't know how  much good it will do you, but at least it gives you some tax language.
As I  mentioned, the last deal was supposed to be a "wire me money, I'll sell you  stuff" deal, but it didn't  happen.
I'd like to see the installment sale form once it gets fixed up, if possible.
