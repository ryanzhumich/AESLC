Ashley, the oven/stove problem should be fixed before the weekend.
If you  have any further problems with it please let me know; I realize it's pretty  old.
I never noticed the control for the oven doesn't even have temperatures  marked on it...the repairman is definitely taking care of that too!
The  handy dudes are coming over to give me an estimate on the kitchen and  bathroom floors and I'm going to also ask them to replace the wood around the  A/C in the second bedroom.
If there's anything else you've noticed that  needs fixing let me know.
