I've just been informed that I'm being switched to Outlook tonite, which  means, I've been told, that I may not have access to my email later this  evening.
If that holds, I'll email the draft to everyone first thing in the  morning (hopefully by 8 AM Houston) time.
Otherwise, it'll land in your  email later tonite.
My apologies for all the machinations.
Best,
