Attached is a very rough draft of the O&M Agreement based on our  discussions.
There are several blanks concerning the numbers and I have  noted several questions thoughout the agreement that need further  clarification.
I am okay with sending this to the operator with the caveat  that although the general substance of the agreement is in place, there may  be some further changes to the language after further review.
Please review.
