Hey, Jen:  I'm not going to email you to death like some people but I hear  through the grapevine that you're having a blast and making tons of friends.
I told your mom that she and I should rent a convertible, don our sunglasses  and drive to Natchitoches to go shopping at the Walmart and take you to  lunch.
She didn't think you would like the idea too much.
Hope you really  are having a wonderful year, making lots of friends and stretching your brain  power.
Love, Sas
