Guys, Swank has confirmed with me that he is committed to join the mid-market  group in east power and make a difference.
I would strongly support his  movement into either SERC or ECAR as per our earlier discussion.
I hope to be moving several experienced dealmakers into the gas and power  mid-market groups to increase our deal-making skills and relationships in  those markets.
I would also hope to move a reasonable number of new  associates (that only rotate within trading and mid-market) to the various  desks.
The goal is  to increase the bench strength of the trading and  mid-market groups plus support John's iniatives on the fundamental groups.
Regards
