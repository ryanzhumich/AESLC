When you have a minute, I've been inputting data all week and have  fixes/upgrades we need to the database.
In particular, the EOL people are  about to introduce a new product any time time now, and I need that sort the  shows "Approved, approved with limits, not approved" to work so I won't have  to look at each of 1500 entries to determine what limits are in place.
When  you arrive Monday can you let me know how long it will take you to have that  sort working.
Then, maybe we can get together and discuss other changes we  need to make.
Much thanks!
