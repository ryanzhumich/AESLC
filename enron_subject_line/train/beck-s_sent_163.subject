I am forwarding a message from a Wellesley student which includes her  resume.
Let's make sure that she is on our interview schedule for our return  visit in November.
I talked with her quite a bit before the presentation,  and was impressed with her.
She has followed up with phone calls and this  e:mail.
I am sending her some additional information on Enron at her request  to help familiarize her with the company.
Her work experience to date has  been with more traditional energy companies.
