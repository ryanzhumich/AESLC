Ashley and I need your address again and your uncles' addresses for Christmas  cards.
How is married life treating you?
Good I hope.
What are you guys doing for  Christmas?
Are your folks coming in?
We are staying in Houston.
Should be nice and quiet.
We are going to have a  few people over for new year's, but nothing special.
