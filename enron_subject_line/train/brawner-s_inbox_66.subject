Brad,  I really don't know where to begin other than just to say it.
Enron is having some extremely difficult times now.
I have been trying to focus on helping Enron stay together.
This is not a good time for you or anyone else to try and seek employment here.
I am sorry if I am letting you down.
I was only wanting to help.
I will always keep you in mind, and hopefully when things turn around here I will be able to address you coming here.
