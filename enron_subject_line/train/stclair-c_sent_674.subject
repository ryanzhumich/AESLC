Carolyn: I'm hoping that you can help me with this.
One  of the gifts that I received  on Friday was 2 outfits from Baby Gap.
There was no card.
The only people  that were at the shower that I couldn't account for based on the gifts that I  received with cards and group gift list that I saw were Anne Yaeger, Mark  Taylor, Tana Jones and Mary Heinitz.
Could you please confirm for me that  these people did not participate on the group gift?
Thanks.
Carol
