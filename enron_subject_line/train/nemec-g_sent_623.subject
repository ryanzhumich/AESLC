Attached is a redlined version of the agreement with the revisions.
Some  revisions beyond  those we discussed with BR were made strictly to clear up  inconsistencies in the original document.
Please review and let me know if  you have any questions.
I plan on being at the Member Meeting in Denver next  week, but please call any time prior if you wish to discuss.
(713) 853-3512.
I will be forwarding the LLC and Administrative Agreement with revisions  tomorrow.
The revisions to these docs are slight and only made to reflect  the be consistent with the substantive changes in the Capacity Allocation and  Expansion Determination Agreement.
