You both may already by aware of this, but the online team has contacted me  and it is their desire to have the Japanese & Australian products also  offered out of the U.S. by Enron North America.
They would continue to be  offered by their current companies, "Enron Australia" and "EnronJapan", but  they want the products sold "24 hours a day" and I guess to do this they  would be offered also by Enron North America.
Do you see any legal issues  from your side with a your Japanese or Australia products being offered by  Enron North America too?
