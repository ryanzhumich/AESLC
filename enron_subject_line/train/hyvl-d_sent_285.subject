Gentlemen:  Here are the revised documents in both clean and marked form.
I made the  requested change in the Term section.
That section defines a Early  Termination as any termination prior to the end of 3 contract years.
As such  no change was needed to the Buyer's Contract section.
Please call if you  need anything further.
Thanks, Dan
