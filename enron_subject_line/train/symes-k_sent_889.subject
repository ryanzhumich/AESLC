The Portland West Desk needs two new traders added to EnPower.
I believe  you're the correct person to contact for this, but please let me know if I  should talk to somebody else.
We'd like to have our mid-marketers enter their  own trades now, and many of them already have the IDs to do that.
Two  marketers - Paul Choi and Greg Wolfe - do not.
I know that when I took over  the Deal Control position here John Forney contacted you to help me acquire a  trader ID, so I'm hoping you can help me with this task.
Thank you,
