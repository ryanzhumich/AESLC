I have made the following adjustment to our EPMI sales to EES on 3/1 at SP-15.
534313 - existing fixed price forward sale - volumes have been reduced by 18  mw per hour  559314 - new index sale added and backdated (2/28)  to reflect 18 mw off peak  hours 559316 - new index sale added and backdate (2/28) to reflect 18 mw on peak  hours  Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this change.
At the  end of last month Short Term California handed responsibility of Dow Jones  index sales over to the Short Term West Services desk; unfortunately the  exact date of change-over was miscommunicated, and the index sale was not  entered for 3/1.
However, the total MWh of EPMI's sale to EES should not  change for 3/1.
Also, you should see the new volumes reflected in the EES  daily volumes worksheet which I will send later this afternoon.
Thanks for your patience,
