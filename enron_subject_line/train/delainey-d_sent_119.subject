David, I don't know if you are the right person to speak with; however, I am  looking for detail to explain the substantial increase in insurance related  cost allocations to ENA for 2001.
We have been given allocation projections  that increase our expense from $3.9M to $8.0M.
I would like to know how this  was determined and the nature of these costs (ie) what assets/positions.
If you are not the right person, I apologize for the intrusion and could you  please pass this on to the right spot.
Regards
