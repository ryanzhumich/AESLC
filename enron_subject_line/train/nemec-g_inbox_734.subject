Gerald, 	Here is the Term Sheet that has been submitted to Oakhill for some time.
It should reflect the following:  	7000 hp ( 2 units rated at 3500 hp each) 	Hanover is expected to package, install and finance for ECS under a 10 yr contract 	ECS will basically Lease - Purchase from Hanover  	Hanover will provide all Maintenance for the contract term for a defined cost.
(I'm working the cost with Hanover) 	 	Power provider = Rusk County Electric Cooperative 	Rate structure = special structure whereby RCEC commits to term fixed T&D, fixed Generation and fixed Ancillary Services 		(EES and ENA are basically a no bid on providing the power into SWEPCO & RCEC)
