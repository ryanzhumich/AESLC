Per my conversation a minute ago with the Koch lawyer in Kansas, Tye Darland,  "Koch Hydrocarbons, Inc." is a bad name.
The correct legal name for this  counterparty should be the same as it is set up in our Master Swap Agreement  database:  "Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon  Company Division".
I have called the Koch trader, James "Doug" Peters  (713/544-5938, ext.
5602) , and asked him to resubmit the Password  Application with the name corrected.
Please show this correction in your  records as well.
