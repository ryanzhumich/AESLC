Lucy: We thought that it would be a good idea to meet with the "weather" group to  introduce ourselves and alos to go over some of the basics, such as  procedures for getting confidentiality agreements processed etc.
Could you  send me a list of who you think we should include in this meeting and Sara  and I will do the rest?
Will a lunch work?
