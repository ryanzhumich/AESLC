COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) - Football practice was delayed on Tuesday  for nearly two hours at Texas A&M University.
One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to look down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown white powdery substance on the practice field.
Practice was immediately suspended by Coach R.C.
Slocum while the FBI was called in to investigate.
After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the foreign white substance that they found was the goal line.
