Clement: We are trying to finalize our ISDA with Deutsche Bank.
In the Guaranty where  we have the setoff and counterclaim language they want to add a proviso that  basically states that Enron Corp. would be entitled to get the benefit of the  rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses that ENA is entitled to  only to the extent taht it would have had the benefit of those rights if it  were the direct counterparty.
I think that I am okay with this but wanted  your input.
Let me know what you think.
Thanks.
