In light of the current circumstances with the company and the concerns that our counterparties have at this time, I would like to leave the upstream business in Denver.
Moving this business would lead to confusion with our customers and to our Denver based employees.
Let me know if you have any issues with this.
If you would like to go up there for coordination and training, then feel free to travel to Denver.
Thanks,
