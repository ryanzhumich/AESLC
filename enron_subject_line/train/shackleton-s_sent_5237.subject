Chris:  I checked with Samantha.
The counterparty is holding two orignal ISDA  documents (complete with boilerplate and Schedule/CSA) and ENA resolutions  (in the form of unanimous consents) and incumbency.
Sam will check on the  ENE guaranty.
There is nothing more that we can do unless you want us to call the  counterparty/lawyer.
Please advise.
