Patti, Stacey,  The new Las Vegas Pool product will bridge into sitara as - Pipe: Kern River Gas Transmission Zone: Las Vegas Facility: UNA - Las Vegas  It is buyer's choice; the pool consists of - Harry Allen (2-4015) Apex (2-4002) Blue Diamond (2-4016) Pecos (2-4013) Lone Mountain (2-4012)  Pecos and Lone Mountain do not seem to be options when manually booking a deal in sitara.
If they are not in the system they probably need to be set up.
The meters will be determined before 10:30 during scheduling.
The deals will bridge with the UNA - Las Vegas meter/facility.
Let me know what you think.
Thanks,
