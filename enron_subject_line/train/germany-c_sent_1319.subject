Here is what Vickie told me about capacity on your pipeline after you  eliminate segmenting.
Example #1  Assumtion: PECO has 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity with a primary  delivery point of PECO in Z6.
What will Enron and PECO be able to schedule Iff PECO releases 10,000 dt/day  of St 65 to PECO citygate under the following scenarios;  PECO schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and Enron schedules gas from  Tetco/Ragley to Z6?
PECO schedules gas from St 30 to St 65, and Enron schedules gas from St 65 to  Z6?
Assumtion #2: PECO released Enron 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity.
Enron schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and from Tetco/Ragley to Z6?
