Suzanne: Please include Jim Crump in the Inland meeting that I need to have with Ken  Curry.
He would like to meet as early on Tuesday as possible as he will be  travelling later on Tuesday.
His assistant's name is Dora Trevino.
Does Ken  Curry have an assistant that can access his calendar?
If not, why don';t you  get a time that works for Jim and me and leave Ken a voice mail message so he  can get back to you on Monday.
We need about 1 hour.
thanks.
