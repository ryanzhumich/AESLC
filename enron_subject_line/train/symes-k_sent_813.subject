Questions about this deal -   1.
Should energy type be CAISO?
2.
Should trade date be 3/7?
3.
Should confirmation status be "NO"?
I believe the answer to all of these is yes, but I wanted to check before  changing anything.
The confirms group is getting extra sensitive about deals  marked for confirmation, since they are now confirming all daily deals.
Just  a reminder to double-check your default settings and your deals for the  confirmation status.
Thanks,
