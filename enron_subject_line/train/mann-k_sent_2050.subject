Attached is the override letter which was used in connection with the LM6000  turbine contract as it was moved into TurboPark.
This letter highlights the  97-10 and lender requirements.
I hope you find it useful.
This is the type of letter that was included for the Pastoria and Blue Dog  equipment.
This shows one approach to assignment under TurboPark.
This is  also included in the other override, it is just easier to access here for  assignment:     Kay
