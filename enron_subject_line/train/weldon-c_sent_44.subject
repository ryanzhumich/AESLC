Bill,  I enjoyed talking with you about our potential software needs.
It sounds  like you may have something to offer in which we are interested, and we are  looking forward to a visit from you or one of your representatives in early  January.
If you want to contact me, I can be reached at 713-345-7229 or by  reply to this E-mail.
Thank You,
