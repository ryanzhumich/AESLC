I have been working with Ramona and Lorraine to make system adjustments to  TW's LFT arising from conclusions made at a Northern LFT meeting a few weeks  ago.
One change that has been called for is that if a Limited Day is called  (for now let's say a total Limited Day, without notifying shippers of any  percentages), no LFT can flow at any time during that day but the LFT shipper  would have the option to flow IT to the extent space is available.
If a  Limited Day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage  would flow, LFT shippers would be able to flow that percentage, and the rest  could be scheduled IT.
Drew latched onto this when I mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this  change with me.
As currently configured, TW's system would allow LFT  shippers to put in nominations on a Limited Day, and if any LFT capacity were  in fact available that LFT would be scheduled.
Similarly, if TW were to  notify shippers of a partial Limited Day (say 50%), and 60% of the capacity  in fact became available, TW's system (today) would allow LFT shippers to put  their nominations in and flow 60%, not limit them to 50%.
TW's tariff  language appears suitably vague to allow this --  a Limited Day is defined as
