Brent, Andrea and I had a "status" conversation this afternoon.
Brent will  go to Sao Paulo on July 20 to meet with Andrea, Randy and commercial people.
Andrea has requested that you and I go to Brazil after July 28 when the  outside lawyer is back from vacation.
In general, the three of us are  conforming and updating physical resolutions (final and proposed) and  identifying additional research necessary to address the financial trading  issues.
These are related to specific deals originating in Brazil (which are  truly settled financially, e.g., a purported prepay where no physical  commodity was to be delivered) and issues arising here in Houston (e.g., the  Hickerson request for fixed income, FX and equity trading).
Brent will be  discussing pending transaction structures while in Sao Paulo.
It appears  that Brent is the "point person" for dealing directly with the  Sao Paulo office and he will bring me in as necessary (although I will be  dealing frequently with Andrea).
