Rick, in the interest of preserving trees and keeping the information  reasonably controlled, I would distribute this to senior managment and the  portfolio managers in each origination group responsible for each investment.
Portfolio Managers  Steve Pruett - Energy Capital Resources - (E&P) Chuck Ward - Generation Investments Chris Helfrick - Industrials and Coal Michael Miller - Principal Investing Richard Lydecker - Restructuring Ray Bowen - CTG Andrea Reed - CTG Wes Colwell - Controller Jordan Mintz - Tax  Management  Jeff Skilling Joe Sutton Mark Frevert Dave Delainey   I don't think we need to distribute this data farther.
The business unit  heads in the finance origination groups can access their portfolio manager  for the data if needed.
Regards
