This will confirm our conversation today regarding which European  jurisdictions are approved for trading credit derivatives:  the U.K., Sweden,  Norway, Finland and Switzerland.
The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives  include:  France, Germany, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and  The Netherlands.
For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it  may be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved  jurisdiction (i.e.
U.S. and U.K. branches).
This would have to be  determined on a case by case basis.
Per our conversation, Canada is also not an approved jurisdiction for credit  derivatives.
Please let me know if there are any changes to this list.
