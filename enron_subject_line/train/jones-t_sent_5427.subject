We are trying to locate the following agreements IMMEDIATELY for a RUSH  project for Louise Kitchen and I understand Mark Holsworth prepared them fro  the EnronOnline team.
Specifically we are looking for agreements with:  Agency.com Octopi?
D'arcy, Masius, Benton & Bowles USA, Inc.  We have a copy of this signed by  the counterparty, but not fully executed by Enron Corp.
If you have a fully  executed copy in your files we would love to get one.
Otherwise, I have a  xerox of the copy signed by them and we could send it up to you to get it  signed by Enron Corp.  Much thanks for your help!
