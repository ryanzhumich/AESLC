Hi, Kristin.
Your Dad asked me to write you and suggest that the two of you  meet for lunch tomorrow at Grotto on Westheimer at 1:00 p.m.
They don't take  reservations, but the lunch crowd should have cleared out by that time.
Let  me know if that's ok with you or if you decide not to drive and need him to  pick you up.
Have a good time.
