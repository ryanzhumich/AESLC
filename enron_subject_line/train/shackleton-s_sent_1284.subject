Hi, David!
Hope all is well.
Since the referenced swap has been documented  by ENA, I am now reviewing the Transaction.
I have a number of questions,  many the result of my unfamiliarity with your Australian Reference/Fallback  weather stations and a few other comments.
I thought I would mark this up  and fax it to you which I will do shortly.
Sara
