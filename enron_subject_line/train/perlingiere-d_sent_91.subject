A draft of a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement was sent via Federal Express  Monday to Thad Shumway of Cinnabar for review.
I left a message this  morning for Mr. Shumway and await is call.
If Cinnabar agrees to the Master, we will accept a fax of their signature on  page 5, and follow with originals for execution.
Dan Hyvl  informed me you  will contact Cinnabar today as well.
I will advise you of our progress.
Please let me know if I can be of further  assistance.
