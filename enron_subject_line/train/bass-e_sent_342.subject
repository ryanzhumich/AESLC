So,  I think Jason is going to go to the game now.
So, I need to buy you and  Mom tickets.
Before I do that, do you have any friends at UH or UT (maybe  Mr. Hamilton) that might have tickets.
If not, we can get some through a  ticket broker or through a scalper the day of the game (probably the better  way).
Let me know
