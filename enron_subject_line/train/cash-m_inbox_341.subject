Michelle:  I would like to recommend that when the H.R.
Representative has an exit interview with a foreign national employee who is being laid off from Enron, that Enron offer them a consultation with Tindall & Foster.
This would enable the individual to talk to the attorneys about their individual immigration status and concerns, after they leave Enron's employment.
I believe it would also show that we are concerned about them.
The approximate cost of this is $150 per hour.
Do you see any problems with this?
Please advise Margaret
