Mark, pls encourage everyone to talk to their customers today and let's let the street know we are as busy as always and that the overall issues are behind us.
I have no new info regarding this matter but believe that the proper vehicles are in place to maintain liquidity.
I am very interested in what the wholesale customers have to say about our issues.
Do they have a mandate to not trade, are they wanting to turn down their exposures etc.
If any customers say this, then let me know.
Pls keep me posted.
BT
