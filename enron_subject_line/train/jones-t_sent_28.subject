Just wanted to check on how the financials are going.
My goal is to get  everything ready no later than the first week of June so I can problem solve  before I have to file by June 11th.
When the financials are ready I need to  get them certified by the highest accounting officer.
Last year that was  Drew Lynch who signed as Vice President, Business Analysis and Reporting.
Will he be signing again?
