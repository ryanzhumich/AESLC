As we discussed, attached is a brief description of ENA's and EES' key goals  in California and the actions underway to achieve them.
We'll update the  status report weekly.
We hope that the weekly update will serve as a useful  internal communication tool to keep folks abreast of activities and  developments in CA.
It can also serve as a tool to help identify the need to  modify our goals and/or actions as circumstances change.
Comments on the form and/or substance of the document and how we can make it  more useful are welcome.
Best,
