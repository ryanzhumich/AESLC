David,  Attached is a short term sheet agreement that I propose we put into  place for the Gallup electric driver which EECC is installing for Enron  Compression Services Company.
As I understand it now, we have only an AFE  with signature for this deal in place.
As I indicated on my voice mail, I  need something more substantial in place for assignment, since we are selling  a portion of this project off to investors.
Please review and lets discuss.
Timing unfortunately is not long as usual.
I would like to meet as soons as  your schedule allows.
Thanks.
