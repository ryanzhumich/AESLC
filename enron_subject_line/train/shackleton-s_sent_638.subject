Just a follow-up to our conversation of last week to see how you were coming  along.
When would you like to schedule some time to discuss the ISDA?
Please let me know if you have any questions and/or whether I can assist you  in any way.
I understand that our respective traders are discussing a  transaction.
You may contact me at 713/853-5620 or e-mail.
Thanks.
Sara
