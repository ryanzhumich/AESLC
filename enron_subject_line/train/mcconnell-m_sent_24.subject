All,   After filling out and gathering all the feedback forms in the last couple of  weeks, Jeff and I just realized that we forgot to ask everyone for an  accomplishment list from each of you.
We have had a very successful 2001 so  far and we need to be able to discuss each group and your personal mid-year  in detail.
Please send us an email with your accomplishments so that we have  all the facts during the PRC process.
This doesn't need to be formal but simply put together and email to both of  us for the appropriate time.
Thanks,
