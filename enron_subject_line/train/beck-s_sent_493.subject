Barry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within EBS.
Since  Scott Pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him  in EBS that are in trading operations, I would suggest that the memo contain  a mention of the transition:  Example:   Scott Pleus is currently Director of trading operations for EBS.
He will be  transitioning to an origination role within EBS in mid May as Barry Pearce  assumes his responsibilities for EBS.
The current trading staff for EBS will  report to Barry effective with his start date in May.
I also heard from Barry today that Todd Lindholm let him know that he is out  of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading  operations and that Barry will report to John Echols.
So sounds as if that  is clarified.
