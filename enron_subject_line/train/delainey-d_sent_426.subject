Rick, we have re-examined the portfolio as a result of our last meeting and  have an expected portfolio of $500M (gross) or $408M (net-ENA's share) to be  placed into Raptor on September 1.
We have a second tranche of $608M (gross)  or $396M (net ENA's share) to be placed into Raptor 2 on December 1.
Kafus, Ecogas, Brigham, Crown Energy and Merlin CLO Equity Option will not be  part of either Raptor 1 or Raptor 2.
Please confirm that this is consistent with you view of capacity and timing.
Regards
