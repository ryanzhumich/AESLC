I entered volume and pricing on the following 2 deals in Sitara;  Deal 418015 CNG citygate with Tenn Prod plus transport pricing.
Deal 418065 CGAS citygate with TRCO and CGLF production pricing and Trco,  CGLF, and CGAS transport pricing (this will take a while to do).
Do we want to turn the auto-confirms OFF?
I think every time I create a VNG  deal, a confirm is faxed to them.
AND if anyone has a better was of doing the deals ( should we show these as  production area sales), please let me know.
The easiest way I can come up  with is to enter the sales at the citygate or storage facility and have most  of the pricing done in a worksheet.
