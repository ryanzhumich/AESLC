Starting tomorrow, 11/28/01 we will be included with the Gas Breakfast and Lunches.
However, there will be a cost of $5.00 each or $10.00 total when breakfast is provided.
They will have lunch everyday and breakfast only three days of the month, which will be during bid week.
I will come around every morning and collect your money...I will then have to provide a list to the Gas people who will be checking your name off as you enter the breakfast/lunch line.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
REMEMBER...ONLY THOSE WHO GIVE THE $5.00 WILL BE EATING.
Thanks for your cooperation,
