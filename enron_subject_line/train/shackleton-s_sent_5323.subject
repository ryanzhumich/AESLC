Tracy/Ed:  We are having some issues with NRG regarding financial confirmations.
We  have executed over 100 financial deals without problems but a recently hired  attorney has begun paying attention to the docs.
THE EASIEST WAY TO RESOLVE  THIS SITUATION IS TO PUT AN ISDA IN PLACE.
Could you please prepare credit  as soon as possible.
The Schedule/CSA should be sent to  david.adams@enrgenergy.com.
Thanks.
Sara
