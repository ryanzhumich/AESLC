Hi Sally,  Attached is the approval letter from the National Council BOD for your chapter's logo product sales at the upcoming convention.
Please let me know if you have any questions after reading it.
Also, the 2002 National Convention Committee is contemplating allowing chapter logo product sales on Thursday, April 25, 2002, the day before convention.
A time for the sale hasn't been specified yet, but would probably coincide with convention registration and check-in.
I need to know ASAP if your chapter would be interested in doing this.
Take Care, Kathy Hoyt               National Council Ways & Means VP   - Wildflowers Approval Ltr.doc
