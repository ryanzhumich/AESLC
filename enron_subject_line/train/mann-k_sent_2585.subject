Gentlemen,  As Dave and John know, I'm working on a deal for ENA (and with Jude) which  has as one aspect a cost plus EPC contract for the construction of a power  plant.
We need to put together the T's and C's for a cost plus contract, and  since it is possible that NEPCO might be the contractor, I wanted to use  something that is acceptable to NEPCO.
I will then take the laboring oar in  order to get a working draft prepared for this project.
As always, I'm on a short time frame, so your response would be appreciated.
Thanks,
