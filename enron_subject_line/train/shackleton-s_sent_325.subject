Thank you for your earlier response.
Enron's offices will be closed on  Monday, September 6 and I understand that your office will be closed on  Tuesday, September 7.
Will you be available for a conference call on  Wednesday, September 8?
I would like to discuss generally the financial  trading issues which I will need to address.
I look forward to hearing from  you.
Regards.
Sara
