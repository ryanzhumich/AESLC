Brooklyn,  What's going on?
How was your holiday?
I thought about you this weekend.
We had fried turkey.
It was sooo yummy.
I was going to bring you some, but  there weren't even crums left.
Well, I just wanted to brag.
So I'll leave you alone.
By the way, how was your trip to Kinder?
Did you have trouble finding the  hotel or resturant?
Later, Robin
