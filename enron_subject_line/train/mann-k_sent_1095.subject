Lee,  Here's a revised draft incorporating your two suggestions:    I've forwarded what I have on the CO (#3) for South America to their lawyer,  so I hope it will be wrapped up soon.
I've seen reference to the Pleasanton CO, and I know it is in the works as  well.
It is percolating through the system.
Do you have the electronic file for the LV CoGen change order (#4), extending  the delivery dates?
I'll be in on Monday, although I have a heavy conference call schedule.
I'll  be easiest to catch towards the end of the day.
Kay
