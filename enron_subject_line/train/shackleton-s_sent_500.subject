Sorry to have to respond via e-mail but I've got laryngitis (although I  should be in most of the day today).
The actual opening of the agreement is simple because we have a good broker  relationship and the agreement is acceptable to us.
BUT, the broker WILL NOT  open the agreement until we can submit the underlying authority which  includes:  authorizing resolutions (or unanimous consent) from the account party trading authorization number of signatures for transacting  Marie previously sent "samples" of the the underlying documentation to Robert  George.
We have not received anything to date.
When we receive the information, we can fax EVERYTHING to the broker and the  account can be opened immediately and then followed up by original hard  copies.
Let me know if you have any further questions.
Sara
