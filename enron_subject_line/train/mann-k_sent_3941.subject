Good morning.
In order to finish up Delta/Salmon tomorrow, please note we need the  following today:  GE parent guaranty LOC (so that full payment can be made to GE tomorrow) Opinion of counsel  And once funds are received by GE, we need the receipt of funds letter.
Lee, I haven't heard back from the Portland gang to find out if the LV Co Gen  contract is ready.
Maybe Jake can help shake that loose.
Thanks,
