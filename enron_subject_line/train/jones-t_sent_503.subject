I got a call from the Lower Colorado River Authority today asking us if we  would like to put a power enabling and ISDA Master Agreement in place with  them.
I spoke to Liz Sager and it appears we have already done a physical  power trade with them.
Of course, we can still not do financial trading  until we run through all the hoops with them.
I don't know who you directed  your marketing package to, but he wanted some information on online trading  and I said we would send him a packet.
