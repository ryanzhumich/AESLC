Group, We are still short 50 mws in ST-WBOM on peak Friday and Saturday at $27.60.
For Friday only (as of right now) I have picked up 10 mws of energy flat (24hr schedule).
I bought this energy from the APX-deal #840719 at $25.
We will be long 10 mws each hour in position manager in SP-15 as a result.
Please sell this energy in the off-peak (on-peak will go to fill our W-BOM short).
I have scheduled an HA 24 purchase from the APX 1 and have put the energy into the ST-WBOM load zone.
