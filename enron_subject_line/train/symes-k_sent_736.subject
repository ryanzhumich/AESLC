Beginning tomorrow this report will contain Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE)   trade numbers and volumes, in addition to EOL and brokered deal information.
Please look for that information at the beginning of the e-mail.
Also note  that the ICE data is released one day later, so it will not correlate  directly to the EOL data below it.
(i.e.
Daily EOL Summary 3/1 will include  ICE data from 2/28) Enjoy...
