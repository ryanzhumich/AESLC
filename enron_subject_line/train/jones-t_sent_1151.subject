Theresa Smith forwarded your comments to the NDA to me.
I ran them by Mark  Taylor, an attorney in our Legal Dept., and am attaching a clean and  blacklined draft reflecting the changes we were able to make.
If your lawyer needs to talk to Mark directly his phone no.
is (713)  853-7459.
I am a paralegal in his group and if you would like to get in  touch with me my phone no.
is (713) 853-3399.
We look forward to hearing  from you.
