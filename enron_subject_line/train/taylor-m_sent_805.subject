Dear Schuyler:  It seems to me that you used to chair a seminar put on by the Euromoney people on swap documentation.
We used to send our new lawyers and more experienced paralegals to the introductory course and the more experienced lawyers to the advanced course.
It appears that Euromoney is no longer putting this on.
Are you doing something similar through another provider?
