With respect to the referenced List: 1.
Ameren Services Company-OK to shut down powe & SO2, as per Credit's  direction 2.
Oglethorpe Power Corporation-they are specifically being opened to trade  power, however, our records do not show them as having a FERC license.
If  they really want to trade power we are going to need a name and phone # to  contact them & get evidence of their FERC license.
3.
Ameren Energy, Inc.-we cannot currently open them up until we investigate  more this agency thing.
It doesn't mean we're shutting them down forever, we  just need more info.
