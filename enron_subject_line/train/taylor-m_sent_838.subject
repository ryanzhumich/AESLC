I finally got my film developed - this gives you an idea of how often I use  the camera - and thought you might like these.
Unfortunately the only shot  on the roll of Bruce didn't turn out - directly attributable to the  photographer's lack of skill - and we never did have anybody take a group  shot.
There were several others that you can tell would have been great  shots if my thumb hadn't half obscured the lens.
The sunset was taken during  our last night there while you guys were swimming off in the direction the  picture was taken (if you listen carefully, you can almost hear Ted losing  his lunch down below).
Hope you guys are well - any trips to Houston on the agenda?
Mark
