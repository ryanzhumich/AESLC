Dear Mr. Junek-  Per Scott Goodell's advice, I am officially informing you that the CES  offshore firm contract is now on your book.
Scott thinks that it is  volumetric, so there should be no impact on you.
The wellhead desk will take  this over as soon as their pools are set up on Col. Gulf.
Sincerely yours,
