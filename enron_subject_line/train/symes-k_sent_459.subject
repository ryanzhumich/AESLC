Pinnacle West is still working on moving all its operations from Arizona  Public Service Co. to Pinnacle.
In the meantime, all TRANSMISSION deals  should still be made using the counterparty name "Arizona Public Service  Company."
All other deals are made with "Pinnacle" itself.
This should change  sometime in the next month, according to the confirmation group in Houston.
Let me know if you have any questions.
