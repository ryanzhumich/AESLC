I spoke with Corporate Compensation yesterday (Kim Bolton) about the option  of paying for stock options/phantom stock with proceeds from the EIP  incentive plan.
She is working on obtaining approval for that provision.
Otherwise, I believe that we are ready to review a final version of the  plan.
Jeanne, could you please circulate one?
I'll be in San Antonio for the law conference the rest of the week, but this  process should not wait for me.
Once corporate comp gives it the ok, we  should be ready to finalize it.
