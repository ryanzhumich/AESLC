MG Ltd. is entering into FX transactions through ENA.
The companies have  also entered into financial copper trades (first trade 6/16/00).
I think RMT  and MG Ltd. should enter into an ISDA Master but I don't know the long term  plan for MG Ltd.
Please confirm.
Sara  P.S.
Have we assigned a single paralegal to handle RMT Masters?
