Tanya:  I have been reviewing some of Gary Hickerson's older master agreements which  may require amending (to provide for multibranch transactions).
I wanted to  verify which master we are relying on for UBS AG.
The files are a little  confusing but it appears that we use the May 31, 1993  Swiss Bank Corporation  master (and not the March 15, 1994 master with Union Bank of Switzerland).
Do you have any recollection of this?
