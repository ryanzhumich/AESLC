Attached is a draft list of items for review.
Some of the items require  immediate document  revisions; others require policy decisions before  revising the documents.
Please edit and refine.
Mark suggested that we  confer and come up with specific recommendations.
Once we create a list,  let's try to meet on one or more occasions to discuss.
