Tom:  I'm trying to finalize the ISDA Master Agreement with these guys.
We have  one issue:  If there is a long-term market disruption event (i.e.
over 3 days), and we  have no fallback price, then we negotiate a price and ENA would normally  obtain 2 quotes and average them.
Our position is that we prefer to obtain  the quotes because if a disruption were to occur, we would obtain quotes for  hundreds of deals in the same manner (because our agreements will all have  the same provisions) and it is possible that 4 quotes may not be available.
NYSEG would like for each of ENA and NYSEG to obtain 2 quotes and then  average the 4 quotes.
Are you agreeable to this?
