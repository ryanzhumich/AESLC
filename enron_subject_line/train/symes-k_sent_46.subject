Happy Monday - or whenever it is that you are blessed with the receipt of  this message.
A funny thing happened to me on my way to upload the PX deals  on Friday.
I went to process the data and was rudely stopped by an error  message stating the following:  Error establishing lock on Trader ID and Trader Date: Trader Already Locked  (_InboxAC11AC92.913Aoc376A1622250.4)   Interesting, isn't it?
So I entered the PX deals manually and went along my  merry way.
Just thought you should know.
