Ken:  Thank you for speaking with Tillman.
As requested, I spoke with him yesterday (along with his CFO).
There was confusion on their part as to what Enron's offer is; related to a meeting some months back by our former bundled group.
I updated them as to our current offering and they expressed interest in receiving some pricing.
The ball is in their court to provide me some information to price their stores, but I hope to receive something from them soon.
I will let you know where we wind up.
Thanks again,
