In order to improve communication between the Legal Department and our Online  team, Mark Haedicke has asked us to prepare a list of legal contacts which we  will be providing to the Online team.
Before we send this out, I have been  asked to send the list to each of you for your input.
Please let me or  Leslie Hansen know of any additional contacts or changes that you feel we  need to make to the list.
