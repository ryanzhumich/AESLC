You have been getting the excel spreadsheets on new counterparties now for  several days, and at an agreed time I would like to include your approvals in  with the rest of Legal's.
Right now I am still telling the EnronOnline  people that they have to look to Australia for approvals.
Once we are in  agreement about the parameters of my responses, and who your backup is, we  can agree on a date when I will start responding for Australia too.
The  theory will be that once I send you the email you will have 24 hours to  respond or I will consider all the online products approved for Ausralian  counterparties.
Because of the time change issue, I think we need to make  the time my approval will go out 4:00 p.m. the next day (which will be your  morning) from the transmittal of the list.
