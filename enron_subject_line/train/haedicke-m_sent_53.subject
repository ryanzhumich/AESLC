Terry:  Greetings.
I have been reading about lliberalization of power markets in  Japan starting next year.
I wondered if you expect IBJ or any of the other  large financial institutions in Japan to make a market in power?
Would you  or someone else you know want to talk about that?
Let me know.
Hope things  are going well.
Take care.
Mark
