Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of  Engage Energy US, L.P., now known as Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P., which  guarantees the obligations of ENA under an  ISDA Master Agreement.
We will  need the standard executed copy.
This guaranty will supersede and replace,  in part, the prior guaranty with respect to ENA and Counterparty.
The  guaranty will be fully replaced when counterparty receives the new Enron  Corp. Guaranty with respect to the obligations of Enron Canada and Engage  Canada (still covered under the existing guaranty, and such replacement is  still under negotiation).
Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the  documents.
Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
