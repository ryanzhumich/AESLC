Jeff:  Dave Komansky, Merrill Lynch's President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, would like the opportunity to meet you.
He is interested in identifying and meeting with potential new Board members and would like to get together with you either in Houston when he is next here in the fall or in New York when it is convenient for you.
Please give me a call at (713) 759-2510 as to whether such a meeting would be of interest to you.
