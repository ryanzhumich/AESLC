Fred: Here is what we sent to Harry Stout.
Lisa has been requesting from them a  copy of the pleadings to make sure that all of our requested changes have  been made and as of yesterday, I don't think that she had received anything.
I will keep you posted on the status of these amendments.
Lisa is the best  person to advise you on the status of the bankruptcy proceedings and the  timing of getting an order signed so that you can commence trading.
