David -   I am putting together the request for assistance from local counsel in Japan  in preparation for opening up EnronOnline to Japanese counterparties.
If you  have a copy of the request you sent to MSJ when you started working on this  for Australia it would be very helpful to me.
I have what we've used in  Europe but would be grateful for your thoughts as well.
Thanks,
