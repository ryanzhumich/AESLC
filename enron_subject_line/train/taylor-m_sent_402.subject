Marcus:  When we were in New Orleans I mentioned that I might be planning a holiday in  Germany - well, I've finally gotten around to scheduling it.
I'm flying into  Munich on the 27th and leaving from Amsterdam September 9.
If you are going  to be in the office next Monday or Tuesday (when I'll be in the London  office), I'd really appreciate a few minutes of your time to get whatever  suggestions you would like to make.
If you will be out next week, maybe we  could chat by phone tomorrow or Friday.
Thanks!
