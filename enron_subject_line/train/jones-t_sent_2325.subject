We just got the executed ISDA Master and guaranty in with the referenced  counterparty, a subsidiary of Hydro-Quebec (you may have noticed my email).
The Counterparty wants to trade with us online immediately.
Can we get them  on as an amended counterparty on Monday's list, and can we get them opened to  trade financial on Monday?
