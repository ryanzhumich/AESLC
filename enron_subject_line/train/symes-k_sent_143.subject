Dave - I'm the new Deal Control staff person here in the Portland office, and I've  been told you're the person to contact regarding counterparty match-ups for  our futures deals this month.
The futures were done today, and if you could let me know of the  corresponding counterparties as soon as you find out, that would be very  helpful.
If there is anything I should know about your job or how we might  help each other work better, please let me know.
Thanks a lot,
