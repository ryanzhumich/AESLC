I sent you an earlier email about the blue files.
Now Erica has received  back the three hole punch I ordered for you (so you could insert paper into  the notebooks I have prepared for you), as well as a request for redweld  manila folders (instead of the blue file folders we ordered for you).
Can  you work out what supplies you want from us.
We are happy to order whatever  you like, but the overseas mail charges are going to increase greatly what  the supplies are worth.
Thanks.
