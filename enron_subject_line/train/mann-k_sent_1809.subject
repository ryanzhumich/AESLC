Hi again.
Here is the consent to assignment which I believe is ready to go.
The only  changes I made was adding the requirement to give notice of the financing in  3 (f), and making the release of WestLB specific to these turbines (1(b)).
I will bring signature pages tomorrow, and will forward the override letter  this evening.
Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
Thanks,
