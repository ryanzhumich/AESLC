Greg, I got confirmation from the Head Coach at JV that AR is not going to UT.
He  scored a 760 on his SAT and apparently overslept a retake exam.
So I don't  know if they actually pulled the offer, but it sure sounds like it.
Either  way, the coach told my wife he will not be a Horn.
The coach is really  dissapointed in AR.
