Rod,  We need to make sure Enron Treasury understands the $300 million plus of NEPCO cash will have to flow back in the next year.
I have been involved in two situations where some smart people in the treasury functions did not really understand this impact.
There is more cash to come from the projects, but for the most part that represents the profits and that cash will not really be ours until we have cleared the retainages and LOC's.
If we can get a couple of new projects in NEPCO, we might be able to sustain the balance, but nothing is secure at this time.
