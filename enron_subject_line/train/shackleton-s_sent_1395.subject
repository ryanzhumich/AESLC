Carol:  Laurel Adams was wondering whether any of the paralegal candidates  who we interviewed might have a good background for "back office" duties.
I  have no idea whether salaries are comparable but she needs someone who can  spot issues and learn the confirm process at the same time (if no experience  in the confirmation area).
What do you think?
