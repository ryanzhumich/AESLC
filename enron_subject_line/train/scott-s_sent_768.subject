Thursday night was indeed a blast.
I think my cohorts were ruing my  existence by the end of the evening because I didn't have to go to work  Friday (wedding in Dallas...very fun).
I'm sure you managed to have an all  right time in SF as well.
I am definitely up for a bucket of beer this  week.
It's supposed to be sunny and warm all week long and I can think of  nothing that goes better with that than cold beer.
As for Austin, I have a  wealth of information on the subject that I would be more than happy to  share.
