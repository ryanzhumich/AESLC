This may appear to be somewhat of a random email, but I assure you there  exist some semblence of reason.
I remembered you mentioning that neither you  nor Pat have ever made a pilgramige to Blanco's.
So...I thought I should let  you know that there is live music and cold beer on tap tonigt at the Big B.
Anyway it should be pretty good.
Music starts at 9:00.
