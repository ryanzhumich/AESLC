Rick,  In preparation for the meeting with the lenders on Tuesday I was reviewing  the GSA and I wonder if YPF has any force majeure claims which could impede  our rights to terminate.
I know they indicated at least verbally that they  had encountered some problems in Argentina.
Although a stretch has Dean or  Novak indicated that this could be a defense?
