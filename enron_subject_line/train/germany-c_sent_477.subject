I just spoke with the lawyer.
We can't do anything until the end of  September.
Then, if no one contest the will, I will go to court on a Friday  morning and be appointed executor.
She said there needs to be 2 witnesses (  and the sons count, so does Mary) to testify that the signature on the will  is Dad's.
