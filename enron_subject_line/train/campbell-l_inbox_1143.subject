As discussed at the recent DES meeting, whenever you need the RO's signature, please use the attached form filled out as appropriate.
I need to review permit applications and permit renewals only.
I do not need to review annual compliance certifications, semiannual monitoring reports, emission test results and any other air related documents prior to getting the RO's signature.
(Make sure you remove my approval from the form for these documents.)
I would like a copy of these documents (electronic or paper) however.
