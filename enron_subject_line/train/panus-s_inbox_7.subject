Dear Fellow Sisters,   I urge you to visit the following website:   www.rawa.org  It is dedicated to informing the world about the repression and persecution of women under the Taliban in Afganistan.
The picture gallery slide show is not for the faint of heart.
I was so moved that I had to send a monetary contribution.
I just hope it helps to end all of their suffering.
Those BASTARDS!!!
Sylvia
