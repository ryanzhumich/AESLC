Drew,  Louise and Robert have brought me into the loop on the employee in London who  has had some issues.
I would appreciate it if you would fax me a copy of his  agreement.
I will be out of the office tomorrow, so, if possible, could you  fax it to my house first thing in the morning?
713-218-7355 is the fax  number.
If you send it around 5:30 am Houston time, then I can have time to  review it and incorporate its provisions into the draft correspondence that I  will prepare on this topic.
I am going to be attending a seminar out of the  office starting around 8:00 am Houston time.
