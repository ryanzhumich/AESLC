Dear Jeff:  I read in the newspaper that you have decided to leave Enron.
I'm sure you are receiving thousands of letters like mine from many admirers everywhere.
As I said to you on other occasions, I truly enjoyed serving on your committee to select the new fire chief.
Your talents and natural gifts are so great that not having you at Enron will clearly be a huge loss for that company and the rest of us in the Houston community.
Best of luck and Godspeed in your next endeavor.
As I said to you the last time we spoke, I still would like to find some way to be on your team in the future.
- Roel
