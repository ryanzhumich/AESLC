Please check the dates for that OpRisk seminar in New York and put those on  my calendar tentatively.
I got a message from Shona trying to schedule a  trip to Mexico and she thought that the week of February 5th looked good.
I  assume that she checked with you and that my calendar looked clear.
While I  have not yet made a decision on attending the NY seminar, I do need to hold  those dates.
I left Shona a message telling her that the week of February 19  would be better.
