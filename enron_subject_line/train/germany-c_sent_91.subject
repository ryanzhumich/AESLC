ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.
This deal was  in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.
I  estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.
Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.
I  believe its in the deal correctly.
Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or  something real intelligent like that.
This deal goes thru 2/28/01.
