Bill,  Here are the changes to the OBA.
Please review.
Also, please look at para 5(c).
Since this gas will only be a San Juan supply, we deleted the Permian and Anadarko price basins.
So, if the TW San Juan pricing information goes away, I would like to use El Paso San Juan Pricing instead of averaging the other two basins.
Questar is coming in for a late lunch, do you think we can have this ready by then?
Thanks,  Kim.
