Attached is a draft of the Master Firm Purchase Agreement between ECS  (Seller) and ECT (Buyer) with a confirm for Bisti  and Bloomfield.
These  mirror the Master Firm Purchase and confirms between ECC (Seller) and ECS  (Buyer).
Please review.
Per our discussion yesterday, ECT will take title  at the West Texas Pool and transport off of TW under the existing transport  contract between TW and ECT.
Mark,  I wasn't sure who needed to see this on ECT's commercial side, so  please forward to whomever is appropriate.
