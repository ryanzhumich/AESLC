As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin  regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.
The ideas generated from this  group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the  markets we manage.
In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity  education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote  aggressive ideas.
Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open  forum for discussion.
Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group  to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 9 at 4:00pm in EB3321.
Jeff & Gary
