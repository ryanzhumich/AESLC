Sneak Preview     I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say about the Ridges and completion of the  gas line in  connection with the financing.
Also on the Interconnection issue  we are still waiting on the Tozzini memo.
We either need to have someone  riding herd on Tozzini on this (I thought it was Jose) or I need to go to SP  and make this happen.
