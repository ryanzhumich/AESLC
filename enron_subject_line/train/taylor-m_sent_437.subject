Joao -   I'm making another business trip to Brazil - this time just to Sao Paolo.
I'll be there Tuesday to Thursday of this week.
Any chance you will be  nearby?
I tried to arrange a meeting in Rio too but unfortunately our office  there is quite small and the only people I need to see will be in Sao Paolo  then.
I also still get to London every once in a while.
Let me know when  you are there - maybe we can have dinner.
Mark
