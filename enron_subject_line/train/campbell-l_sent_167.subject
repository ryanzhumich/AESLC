The State of New Mexico has issued the settlement penalty for the turbine  replacement issue at the P-1 C/S.
You may remember that the original amount  levied against Transwestern in 1997  was $14,700.
After the Air Quality  Bureau sat on this issue for more than 4 years, they reassessed the penalty  to be $162,770.
I would like to get together and discus what our options are  on this.
