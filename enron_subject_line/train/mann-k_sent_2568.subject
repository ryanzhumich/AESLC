Ace,  I'm a lawyer at ENA.
We are selling some of our peakers, and in conjunction  with the sale we have agreed to not contest Siemens Westinghouse retaining  the Blue Girl reservation payments.
SW has asked that LJM sign off on the  agreement, and Rose has suggested that I send the original agreements to you,  and indicated that she would help coordinate signature.
Your help is appreciated.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
