I just spoke with Miriam Radich (Tiger's lawyer) and advised her of ECT's  name change effective 9/1/99.
She advised that she will revise our docs  TOMORROW.
Also, we will send a new blackline guaranty to Tiger (terms  previously agreed) to reflect name change.
Per:  It may take several days to have the guaranties executed by Corp.  You  need to give Marie advance notice on that front.
