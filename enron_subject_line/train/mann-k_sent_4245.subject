I've taken the liberty of drafting a form of extension letter to extend the  ILA until June 15.
I suspect Reagan will be distributing to the commercial folks, but I thought  I would give you a heads up.
David, I'm at work on revising the longer term doc.
If you have your  preamble stuff ready, I'm happy to put it in now.
Thanks,
