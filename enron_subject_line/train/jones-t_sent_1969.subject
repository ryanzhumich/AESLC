On the list for 9/19/00: 1.
On the counterparty styled "United States Department of Interior" only,  Leslie is not permitting them to trade power, however, she will give them  read access.
2.
Public Service Electric & Gas Co. - My notes show I already opened them  for financial power  On the list for 9/21/00:  I am OK for shutting Aquila Energy Marketing  Corporation down for financial, since they are now trading financial out of  Utilicorp.
However, I didn't want to put "X's" in all those darn boxes, so I  hope by my note only it will do the job.
I am also preparing an assignment  of the online trades that I will send to the Confirm Desk when it is executed.
