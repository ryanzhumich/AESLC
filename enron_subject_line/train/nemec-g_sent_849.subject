Attached is a form agreement for the Oakhill Transaction.
Please note the  italicized sections of the CSA.
I am not sure what the terms quoted to  Oakhill have been with respect to interruptions in service and adjustments to  energy pricing.
We may want to leave these sections blanks for now.
Please  review and let me know if you have any questions.
