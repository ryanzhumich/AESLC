John: Thanks for your voice mail message.
I will wait to hear back from either you  or John M. before I respond to Reliant on our issues list.
I do agree with  you on all of the points that they need to address.
On the Event of Default  issue, do you think that Janet Greene's proposed language to the "null and  void" sentence as well as the drawing certificate works?
I was concerned  that the language "Event of Default under the Confirm" may lead to some  confusion as to what Events of default are covered.
What do you think?
