NNG had EDI problems this morning,  Evidently TMS ran out of disc space cau= sing all of the files to get hung up in the HUB for the Final cycle and the=  ID1 cycle.
The help desk was paged at 7:35 a.m. to report the problem , To= by responded, but was having trouble reaching the on call TMS.
We did not g= et a response until 8:55 a.m. from TMS , the EDI files were in the HUB for = over two hours.
Mary Draemer was very helpful and made follow up calls so w= e could relay an estimated time frame to our customers when this problem wo= uld be resolved.
Monday 12/31/2001 we also experienced printer problems , w= e were told that a print server was down, the Solution Center was redirecti= ng print servers on an individual basis at our work stations.
Kathy Washing= ton could not print this morning and had tried to contact someone at the So= lution Center, and did not receive a response back for quite a while, we we= nt through the Help desk (Toby) and either he contacted Glen or Glen respon= ded to the earlier page, We had several technical problems to work through = this morning, but the most critical problem was trying to reach our support=  people.
