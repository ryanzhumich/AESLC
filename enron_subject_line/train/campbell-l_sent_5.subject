Based upon valving constraints and the innaccessability to the inside of the  pipe between our M/S and the Topock C/S, a decision has been made to postpone  cleaning of his section of the pipeline.
should cleaning occur of this  section, it is anticipated that it will not occur untill the installation of  the filter separator at the PG&E C/S, sometime later this year.
Vector has  been notified of this change in plans and will adjust their cleaning  schedule  accordingly.
