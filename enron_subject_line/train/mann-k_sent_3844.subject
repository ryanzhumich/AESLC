Might close on the letter agreement today.
You didn't miss much - mostly  negotiations with GE re: change orders.
Our tax guys are happy, and  Accounting is hanging in there.
We have revised the payment schedule in the  doc, but NW doesn't have the change.
I'll send it to you.
The change is  minor.
I need to revise the assignment/assumption agreement, then we'll be  ready to go when GE signs up to the CO's.
