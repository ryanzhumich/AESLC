Mike (Smith): Since things will move pretty quickly from this point forward, we want to  have a quick meeting to explore our legal options and how best to preserve  them.
We'd like to have a kickoff call after the daily 10 AM (CST ) call  that Wanda Curry handles.
Are you available after Wanda's call?
Say 11 AM  CST?
Thanks.
Best,
