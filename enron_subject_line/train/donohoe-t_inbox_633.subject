I'm not sure if you are planning to do any deals on Reliant Field Services for Dec 1 but I wanted to let you know that Field Services called me this morning to tell me that our invoices have not been paid and if they weren't paid by the end of the week, we would not be able to nominate on their system for Dec 1.
I passed her call on to Mark McClure, who is the supervisor in Volume Management.
I will keep you posted with any new information that I receive but wanted to let you know of this problem before you purchased any gas to be transported on their system.
