I received a call from Ralph Komai, PCB engineer with SoCal, about a pipeline  liquids collection SoCal wants to take at our Needles facility.
Ralph said  that SoCal will be undertaking a study on their pipeline to determine why the  concentration and liquids volume of PCB's has reduced into their system in  the past couple of  years (97-2000).
I shared with Ralph and up until this  year, we have not had liquids at the Needles facility since 1994.
He stated  that they have seen reduced concentrations and are curious as to why this  trend is occurring (sounds like good news to me).
He said that their data  shows the following:   1998 liquids concentrations  only 1% regulated at the federal level   1999 liquids concentrations only 8% regulated at the federal level  Ralph has requested that SoCal be allowed to collect a  liquids sample at the  Needles M/S and I have contacted the Needles team about assisting SoCal with  the collection.
I would expect that this may have implications with respect to slight  increased billing for analytical charges that SoCal will be charging us for  and we reveiw on a quarterly basis with them.
