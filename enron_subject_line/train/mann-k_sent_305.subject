Gentlemen,  Due to some internal comments we have made some revisions to the land option  agreement.
The most significant change is that it is clear that the option  payment is not refundable, and will not be applied against the purchase  price.
There is also a clarification in paragraph 9 (re assignment) that the  assignee remains responsible for any liability arising prior to assignment.
I believe we are ready to go forward with signature when you are.
Please  advise if this version is acceptable.
Also, please let me know if you would  like for me to have a redline version prepared.
Kay
