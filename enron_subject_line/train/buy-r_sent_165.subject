Spoke w/ Skilling re OI "binary" decision.
He is willing to enter into the  deal.
His rational is that he thinks we will be ok on OWC in the final  analysis.
He did  say to reserve for the deal adequately and structure it as  appropriate for the circumstances.
He also wanted to know if there is  anything different here than on OWC.
I told him that it wasn't significantly  different (both strong underlying businesses with huge event risk attached)  Lets get dash completed and then I will voice mail Jeff w/ specifics and get  his verbal signature.
