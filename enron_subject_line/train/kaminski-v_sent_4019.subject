Dale, Richard,  I am ready to cover the cost of Steve's trip to Houston (one month in the  summer).
I think very highly of Steve and think about coaching him a bit to expand his horizons.
I see him as a very valuable asset of Enron and a great leader in not too distant future.
He needs exposure to more diverse business problems and areas of research.
I think it will be in the best interest of  the company to devote some resources to foster his development.
Vince
