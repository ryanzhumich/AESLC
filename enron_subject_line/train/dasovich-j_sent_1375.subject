Professor Aceves:  Attached are a word and an excel file.
Both are formatted for easy print  out.
Note that the excel file has two work sheets:  "balance sheet" and  "income statement."
I'd be happy to provide you with a hard copy, too, if  you would prefer a hard copy.
Just let me know.
Thanks for a great course.
All the best,
