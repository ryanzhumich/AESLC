Sorry I never called yesterday...I had turned my phone off and didn't realize  you'd called until last night.
I'm still at work right now and therefore am  extremely tired.
Hope you got everything you needed to accomplished this  weekend.
I had a good time at the game and, thanks to Travis's pledge class  reunion, have come to the conclusion that 27-28 is a better age range for  me.
There young enough to excuse being single due to career focus and still  old enough to know who they are and what they want.
Some critical things  happen in those 3-5 years from a man's late twenties to early thirties that  can expose so many "issues" (examples of which I got to see several of on  Saturday).
Talk to you soon, Susan  Are you and Doug going to OU?
