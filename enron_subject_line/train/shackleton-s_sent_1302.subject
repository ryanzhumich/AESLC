Mark:  Thus far, I have uncovered only one "nondocumented" electronic  agreement.
The equity desk uses the services of POSIT which is an electronic  trading system which matches orders six times daily for institutions and  broker dealers.
There is no agreement for this matching service.
I am not  aware of other "matching services" and whether any agreements are in place.
Let me know if you have any concerns.
Thanks.
Sara
