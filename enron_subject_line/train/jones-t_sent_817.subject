Rick Tucker at Pan Canadian (he used to be at PG&E) called and has been  speaking to Willie Harrell on the Confirm Desk, and I believe Willie spoke to  Mark about this issue yesterday, but it appears to be unresolved and I think  Mark was going to talk to you about it.
Pan Canadian is doing EOL trades, and wants to know why he keeps getting the  online confirms w/the GTC's attached since the way the system is set up he  technically is already agreeing to the GTC's online.
He feels he is having  to look at a lot of unnecessary paper.
Rick will be out of the office Friday and Monday, but was hoping you could  give him a call Tuesday to discuss this issue.
His phone # is 713/331-5049.
FYI, we do not have a master in place with Pan Canadian Energy Services.
