My tickets are in the student section for the game - I have four.
I don't  know if you want to sit in the student section b/c you really won't be  sitting much - most of the students stand up the entire game.
So, if you  want to sit, we need to work on getting some seats in the alumni section.
Jason - if you and Donnita want to come, you can have my two extra seats in  the student section, assuming what I said above is correct.
Let me know
