Group, As most of you are aware we changed time zones on Sunday.
We are back in Pacific Standard Time.
As such, we are once again in a different time zone than some of our counterparties.
Please specify Pacific time zone in your summary of your deal at the end of each phone call--translate the deal to Mountain time only if necessary.
We must be very clear on this going forward or disputes will be numerous and we will not be able to resolve them.
See me if you have any questions regarding this expectation.
