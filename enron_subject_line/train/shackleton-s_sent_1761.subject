Mary:  I hear through the grapevine that we may be trading through Bank One.
In any event, we need to add all of the executed agreements to the Lotus  Notes database.
Samantha should be able to handle this for you since she  maintains and updates the brokerage reports and keeps the files near her  desk.
Thanks.
Sara
