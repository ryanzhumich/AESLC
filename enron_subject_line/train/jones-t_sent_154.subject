I got a call while you were away from a woman at an affiliate of National  Bank of Canada, they want to see our standard form of Repo Agreement to put  in place for one of their affiliates "Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.", 1155  Metcalfe Street, Montreal, QB  H3B 5G2.
The contact is Theresa Pace (French  pronounced) and her # is (514) 397-5850.
I spoke to Harry Arora about it,  and he said Darren Delage is working on it, and Darren is out the week on  vacation and to wait til he gets back next week to send it out.
So when you  have a minute, let's talk about what to do.
