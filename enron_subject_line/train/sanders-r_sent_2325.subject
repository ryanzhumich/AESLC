Did we ever hear anything more from Mark Woolfolk?
He was the attorney from  Akin Gump in Houston who interviewed last month.
All of the comments I  recieved were very positive.
The last I heard, you were talking to him about  salary, but you were concerned that he was too far above our compensation  level.
Please let me know what I should do to follow up.
