Robbie: I was in your class that you taught for the Princeton Review at Enron just  recently.
What I'm looking for is a private Math tutor.
I wasn't sure if I  had to go through the Princeton Review or if I could talk directly to you.
I  liked the way you taught the class and wanted to see if you taught one on one  sessions.
If you could let me know, I would appreciate it.
Thanks!
