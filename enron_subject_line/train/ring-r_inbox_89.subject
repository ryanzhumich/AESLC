Generator Operators,  	If you received this email then you should have been given access to the new generators directory.
At your earliest convienence please verify that you have the correct Read/Write access to the directory listed below by creating and deleting a file inside of it.
At the present time we are still working with people in the IRM (Information Risk Management) group who have made this request a very high priority; as soon as this verification process is complete we can release them from this task and begin working on transitioning all of the generators' code to function in their new home....(the sooner the better).
Please respond to this email, or contact me by phone the moment you have verified your access.
If you receive an 'Access Denied' error message then verify that you are mapped to the R: drive using your Corp account and try again before responding to this email.
A link to a test file in the new directory is below, you may save time by selecting the link to access the folder.
