Dear Vince J Kaminski,  As a Mathematical Trading and Finance MSc student (City University London) I am writing my dissertation on "power forward curves".
Since you have participated in the writing of the book "Managing Energy Price" I was wondering if you could eventually help me.
The MRHV model seams to be the best econometric one to model the electricity forward curve.
I understand and know how to work out with the classic Mean Reverting Process, but I don't understand the MRHV (I don't know the discretised form and I cannot even find any paper, or article on it) and how to get rid of the exponent to estimate my parameters (long-run mean, Speed of mean reversion, volatility, exponent, Floor price).
Thank you by advance for any help  Yours sincerely
