We have accepted your suggested revision to Article 13 of the Agency and  Management Agreement.
Attached is a new executable with the language  revised.
Also attached for execution are the gas purchase confirm and  associated GTC for the gas purchase through Monday June 4.
The GTC was  revised to remove the $0.15 per MMBtu liquidated damages.
Thanks.
