As we discussed this morning, I have reviewed the subject agreement that you  faxed to me.
As I indicated yesterday, if I had been provided to agreement  for approval by HPL, I would have approved it for execution.
I still feel  that we should always have a waiver of consequential damages provision in the  agreements, however, as I indicated to Mitch, the risk of such damages is  very minimal.
I think the resolution that you, Stacey and Mitch worked out  by changing the term to monthly is excellent.
This will allow you to replace  the agreement in the future when TXU has developed it new form.
Please call  me if you need anything further regarding this matter.
