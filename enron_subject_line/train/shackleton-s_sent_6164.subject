Melissa:  I started with Sempra.
It's one of the more unusual masters ( a "Master  Master"  covering both physical and financial) and it's not the typical "ECT  Master".
Further, it contains no rounding or correction to published prices  provisions.
We'll have to review these masters on a case by case basis.
