Dale,  To follow up on our conversation, our only problem is in the short  description.
We would like to make in simpler.
Possibly  reading  " Gas Daily Index" as the product type  Also it seems that the long description in product manager  that we approve  while  copying  a product does not match the long description after the  product is created ???
