I will initiate the call and I will also conference in Andrea Bertone.
Attached is a short list illustrating the types of financial products about   which our commercial people are inquiring.
My goal is to discuss parameters  for further legal/tax research required to assist Enron in deciding how to  trade these products.
I look forward to our conversation.
