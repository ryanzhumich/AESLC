Attached is the URL to get to what should be a real audio broadcast of  tomorrow's PUC business meeting.
The meeting starts at 10 AM PST.
Many who  have tried to use the link in the past have been unable to connect, but the  PUC may have since worked the kinks out.
I will be at the meeting and will  report back via email.
Best,
