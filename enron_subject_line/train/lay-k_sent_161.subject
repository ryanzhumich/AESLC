Russell, I think it will be Kenneth.Lay@Enron.com.
Do we capitalize all the  words, but com?
I noticed that mine is Rosalee.Fleming@Enron.com.
I had  sent something to my home e-mail address.
This may not be a good test as I  am sending it from my home computer, from his mail-box, but not from his  computer.
Oh, well, we'll see!!
