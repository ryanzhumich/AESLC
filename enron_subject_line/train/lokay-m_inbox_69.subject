Michelle,  Per our conversation, PPL EnergyPlus requests that Transwestern assign 20,000 mmbtu of primary receipts out of the West Texas Pool for the period beginning June 1, 2002 through September 30, 2002.
During the four month period beginning October 1, 2002 and ending February 28, 2003, the primary receipts will be reduced to 14,265 mmbtu.
Beginning March 1, 2003 through June 30, 2032, primary receipts will be increased to 20,000 mmbtu.
For the four month period beginning October 1, 2002 and ending February 28, 2003, PPL requests an additional day to consider our supply options prior to electing a primary receipt for the 5735 mmbtu not assigned.
Best Regards
