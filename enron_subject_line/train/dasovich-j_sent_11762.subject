Please don't use this yet.
Refinements are underway by Alan Comnes, but  wanted to give you a flavor for how underwater the DWR contracts are (if  marked to market today).
Jim's got it , too.
Based on recent curves, $21B of the DWR contracts are stranded.
Will give  you the update once it's done (likely tomorrow).
Best,
