I forwarded a guy down to Credit on 5/9/01 from the referenced counterparty  who wanted to get an ISDA in place with us.
I told him he would have to  speak to our Credit Dept.
first, and from the tone of his voicemail it  doesn't sound like he's heard from anyone.
Can you make sure that someone  calls him so he doesn't call me again.
His name is Greg Bass and his no.
is  619/696-3177.
Thanks.
