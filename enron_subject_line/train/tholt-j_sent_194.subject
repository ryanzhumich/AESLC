If it is not too late I would like to put on hold my request to add Barrett  Resources to the EOL Product for El Paso Blanco Average.
I made the request  yesterday so hopefully I am not toolate.
Upon discussing the product with  Barrett, I do not think this would be a good idea to add them at the present  time.
I willkeep you advised.
Thank you for your patience.
