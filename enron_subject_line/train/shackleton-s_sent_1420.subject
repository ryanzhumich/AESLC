Donna:  It's been awhile since we last spoke about advising Enron companies  of existing brokerage accounts.
It has also been determined (in legal) that  the accounts will remain with ME and not move to Alan A.  I have some  temporary assistance in that an A&K lawyer, Jason Peters, is working up here  for another few weeks.
I was hoping that we could all meet and put our  "project" into action.
Please give me a call and suggest some time when we  may meet.
Thanks.
Sara
