Currently, we are unable to use IT to serve Ogy at Doyle on Transco.
I have devised a super scientific method for pricing VNG space for Ogy.
Poke all the holes in it you want.
Use the following formulas to determine the price to Ogy  The higher of St 65 Offer plus $.35 TCO Offer plus $.14  Good Luck
