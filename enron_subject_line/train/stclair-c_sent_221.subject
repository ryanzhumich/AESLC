Steve: Just wanted to let you know that Bill is running for an open position on the  Cy-Fair School Board.
The election is Saturday May 6th at Emmott but early  voting takes place tomorrow from 8-12 at the instructional Support Building  on Jones Road.
If you and Julie are planning on voting and are undecided, I  hope to solicit your support.
His opponent is Don Ryan.
