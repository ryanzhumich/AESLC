The continued growth of the Enron Europe office and related businesses has  prompted a change in the management of Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) in  London.
Effective in early January, 2001, Ted Murphy will transfer to the  London office and mange the RAC activities which include credit and market  risk and underwriting.
Ted will continue to manage the Enron Global Market  Risk activities.
Steve Young, currently managing RAC in London, will begin a  new assignment within  EBS, also in London.
The Houston Market Risk group will be managed by David Port   As Enron continues to expand its trading and risk management businesses, it  is vital that trading and credit policies are administered in a consistent  and accurate manner across the company.
Hopefully this realignment will  accomplish that goal.
Please join me in congratulating Ted, David and Steve on their new  assignments.
