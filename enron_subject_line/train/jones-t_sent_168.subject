Global counterparty is trying to locate online corporate search companies  that can check company names in Europe and Canada.
In the U.S. we can access  this information via Westmate in Westlaw.
Are either of you aware of any  online search company, or can you direct me to someone who may be aware of an  online search company, for Canada and Europe?
If there are no online search  companies available, is there a reasonably priced corporate search company  that can verify this information for us?
I appreciate your help.
