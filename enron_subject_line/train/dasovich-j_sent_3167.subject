Hi Justin:  As we discussed, this is the most recent version of the proposed "fix" to the  Direct Access prohibition included in AB1X that the coalition of customer  groups have been working on.
They intend to give it to Debra Bowen first  thing next week.
Take a look at it and if you have any questions, please let  me know and I can explain the concept and how it is intended to work.
I have  notified the coalition that it would be a good thing to include you on their  distribution list, but I didn't want to do that until I checked with you.
Let  me know if that's something that you would like to do.
Best,
