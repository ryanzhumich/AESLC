Ed: I spoke with our credit people today.
We would like to arrange a call to  discuss our concerns about Section 5 of the Guaranty with me, our credit  people, your counsel and your credit person or someone that can make a  decision if we propose a change to the Guaranty.
Can you let me know who  these people are (and their phone numbers) so that we can arrange a call?
We  understand fully your need for the Section 5 language, but we would like to  explore with your people whether your concerns can be addressed in a  different manner.
Thanks.
