Professor Berk:  Very interesting to hear the perspectives of a South African ex-pat last  evening.
Today's been very hectic, but I'll get back to you on the possibility of  having Enron sponsor internships for the financial engineering program.
Until we've had a chance to talk, could you wait before forwarding my name  along to anyone else in the fin eng group?
Much appreciated.
Best,
