Mr. Derrick,  I met with Robert Taylor this week at your residence and had a very productive meeting.
One question that came up was the use of security cameras.
Areas that we discussed using cameras were:  Gate at Larchmont Driveway gate  Please let me know if that is something that you are interested in or would like to discuss.
thanks Alan
