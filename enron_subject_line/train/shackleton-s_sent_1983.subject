Sharon:  Thanks for your fax and markup of the Schedule dated Sept. 6.
There  is a major issue which we need to discuss and that is the counterparty  identity itself.
It appears that you have identified a DIFFERENT party to  the agreement, namely, a limited liability company named "SITA", which is not  the entity which we originally proposed,.
This does not appear to be the  credit which we evaluated.
Also, we insist upon a Credit Support Annex.
As you know, the agreement  contemplates multiple transactions and the posting of collateral is a major  issue, particularly for long-dated pulp deals.
