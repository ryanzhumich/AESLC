Beth Apollo has recently joined the team and Brenda Herod has recently  married.
February and March were gone before I could get organized enough to  try to celebrate both of these occasions.
In honor of Beth's arrival and  Brenda's marriage, I hope that you can join David and me for drinks and  appetizers at our house on Saturday, May 5, followed by dinner at Champions  Golf Club.
Please include your spouse or a guest, and know that we will also  be happy to just have you attend.
Let me know if that date will work for  you.

Hold the Date
