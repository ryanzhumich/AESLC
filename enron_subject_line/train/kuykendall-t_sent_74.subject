We need to get something for Ina for Admin Asst's Day - it is tomorrow.
I  will take a collection of $10 from each person and get a gift certificate  from Foley's if that is okay with everyone.
I will probably have to go get  the gift certificate tonight - so please dont stick me with more than my  share of the bill.
( Thats what happened last time)  Thanks.
