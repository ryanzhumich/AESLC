It turns out the initial auction product will not be the emissions credits  but rather the EnBank UK synthetic gas storage product.
They want this  auction to allow bids to be revoked or revised up until the end of the  auction period and not to have the ability to accept bids until the  expiration time.
There is still no commitment to sell anything.
All  transactions will be for sales by Enron to the counterparty.
I have taken a  stab at revising the procedures language with this in mind.
