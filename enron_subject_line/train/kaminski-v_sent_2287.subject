Shirley,  Please, send it to the entire group.
Vince  ****************************************************************************** ****************  This is another reminder about the responsibility we have as a group for cleaning the conference rooms after  meetings.
For many  visitors to Enron a conference room maybe the first and the last exposure to the company.
Last Thursday, some members of the group left, leaving behind their lunch  boxes on the table.
Please, don't embarrass me by having to point out to you that  your mothers  don't work here.
