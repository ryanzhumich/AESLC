Under separate cover, I will fax to you a copy of the February 6, 1998 legal  opinion which, from my research, created the "issue"  between SG&E and Enron  North America Corp., formerly Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.
It might  be easiest if SD&G reissues the opinion without the qualification contained  in Paragraph 5.
Please let me know what you think.
Regards.
Sara
