Barbara, here is my draft of a rehearing request.
As I mentioned, our  outside counsel is going to try to add a few sentences; I haven't heard back  from them, but will send you the revised draft when I do.
I'd be happy to  copy Jay Golub too; please send me his e-mail address.
In the meantime, let  me know if you have any comments.
We plan to file on Monday, Oct. 16.
Thanks,
