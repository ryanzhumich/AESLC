Good afternoon,  I am circulating a draft of the long term agreement for your review.
There  are still holes, but hopefully it sets out the basic commercial deal.
Please note that  we are anticipating a Monday meeting.
Therefore, we have  sent this out without the usual internal review.
We hope to have a set of exhibits shortly.
Talk to you soon,  Kay
