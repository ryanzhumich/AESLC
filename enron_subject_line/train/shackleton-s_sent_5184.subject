Clint Freeland (who is trying to remain optomistic) would like to have  signature pages for the forwards executed prior to final negotiation.
We are  drafting Bear.
We can print signature pages for CSFB and UBS which are on  single pages.
Lehman will be emailed (I think) tomorrow.
Please follow up with me please.
Thanks for your help.
