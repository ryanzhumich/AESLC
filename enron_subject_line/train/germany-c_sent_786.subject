I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 (no changes on this  ticket), 268090, and 268093.
Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth.
We will show this  volume coming out in June.
I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the  volumes coming out in August.
I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August.
Let me know if you have any questions.
