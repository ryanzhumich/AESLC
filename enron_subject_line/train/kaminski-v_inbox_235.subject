Vince,  I have gotten notice from EGM that they want to charge your cost center for the use of a weather research system named Avistar that someone is your group is using.
The plan is to allocate part of the depreciation of the asset to your cost center.
The total cost will be $10,583 over a 3-year period so the cost will not be significant, but I wanted to be sure you were aware of and approved of this charge.
Please let me know.
Thanks,
