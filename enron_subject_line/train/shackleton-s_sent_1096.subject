Sheila Glover has requested that David Vitrella be designated as a second  "Authorized Trader" for the Enron Communications Investments Corp. account  which was recently opened with Morgan (having as its purpose the sale of  Rhythms stock).
The rationale for a second trader is not new to us:  in John  Greene's absence, no one is authorized to trade in that account.
It is my  understanding that the only activity to occur in this account is the sale of  this particular stock which will be "dribbled in" periodically.
Please let  me know if you have any questions.
Both Donna and Sheila are very familiar  with this transaction.
