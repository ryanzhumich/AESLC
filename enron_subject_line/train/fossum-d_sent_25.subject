Thanks for the tip last night!
I called and ragged around my thieving ins.
company this morning and they are going to cough up some serious insurance  for me and Sandra at suuper-cheap pre XXX prices.
Cool.
My only concern at  this point is that my over-insured status may create undesirable incentives  for the little ladies in my life (the dreaded "worth more dead than alive  syndrome"!)
Adios amigo!
