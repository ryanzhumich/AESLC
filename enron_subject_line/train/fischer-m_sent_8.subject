Tom,  I have energy estimates for May 2002 attached.
Graph 1 is site totals, graph  2 is (total lost)/(total actual production) where total actual production is  taken from the kWh reported in the owner report, and graph 3 is the by  turbine distribution (using box plots) of energy lost.
The energy lost estimation method I employed is susceptible to problems with  data recovery (10-minute data), which in May 2002 was especially poor at  Klondike and Fenner, so those number are not as informative as those for the  other sites.
If these graphs provide you the information you need, I will continue with  the remaining months (Jan - Apr).
Otherwise let me know and we'll refine this  process to get you what you need.
Mark
