I can't believe that I said what I did this morning.
It was selfish and I  sincerely appologize.
I don't know what I was thinking or why.
Well,  I  just listened to your message and I deserve all of it.
Even though you may  not believe it.
I do love you, but many times cannot justify my actions.
I  love you very much, and will call you later.
