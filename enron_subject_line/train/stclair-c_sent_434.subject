Maria: I think that 2 minor chnages need to be made to the Enron Guaranty and  probably the PSE&G Guaranty:  1.
Change in the first paragraph "Enron North America Corp., a Delaware  corporation to Enron North America Corp., a Delaware corporation and its  successors and assigns  2.
In the definition of "Agreement" include language that would pick up  amendments, supplements, replacements and restatements thereof so its reads  :"such ISDA Master Agreement, together with each Confirmation exchanged  between the parties thereto and together with any and all amendments,  supplements, replacements and restatements thereof, hereinafter the  "Agreement")  Let me know if you have a problem with this.
