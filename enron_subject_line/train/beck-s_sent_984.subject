Just wanted to drop you a note to let you know that I will be in the London  office during the week of January 15.
I will arrive just after lunch on  Monday and plan to be there through Thursday.
Much of my time will be spent  with Fernley and Mike Jordan.
If you have a few minutes while I am in town, it would be great to get with  you to hear if there is anything that is of particular concern or interest to  you in supporting the continuing growth of your business in 2001.
I will  stop by while I am in the office.
