Hi, Kristin.
Your Dad asked me to get in touch with you to see about setting  up some lunches for the two of you.
He's traveling quite a bit again in  October, but I'll give you the dates he's available and you tell me which of  those days you can do it:  Friday, October 13 Monday, October 16 Thursday, October 19 Thursday, October 26 Wednesday, November 1 Monday, November 6 Friday, November 10 Monday, November 13 Tuesday, November 14.
I'll hold all of these dates for you until I hear back from you.
Would you  be able to go at 12:00 noon?
