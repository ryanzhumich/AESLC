John,  Attached are the case historys for the two cases.
Note:  Followed - means the court followed the holding in the case cited Dissenting Opinion - means the dissenting justices referenced the case only  (not really relevant) Distinguished - court didn't follow the holding of the case or simply found  that the facts of the two cases were different.
Hope this helps.
