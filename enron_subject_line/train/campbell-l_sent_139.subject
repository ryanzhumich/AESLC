Bob, James, Roger,  Im having a hard time getting a response from the teams in the Midland Region  in completing the attached EOTT tank spreadsheet.
Ive heard from some of the  teams but nothing from others.
Im under the gun as to finding  out where the  MIdland Region is in term of permits and and environmental compliance and the  only way I can begin to make the evaluation is to have the field data inputed  onto the spreadsheet.
This is where the teams assistance is required.
I  have attached the latest version of the spreadsheet in the hope that you will  deliver it to the following teams for their valued input:   Monahans Team  Hamlin/Haskel Team  Lamesa Team  Big Lake Team  Midland Team  Eunice Team        Your assistance in this will be greatly appreciated.
