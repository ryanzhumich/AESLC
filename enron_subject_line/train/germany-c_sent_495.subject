Some questions about the 1st.
Per the proxy, we should be injecting 26,219 dt/day into storage.
You are  showing 36,304 dt/day on the FOM sheet.
AND I see a citygate load of 29,461  dt/day.
This morning Tim Ray sold Dick 23,060 dt/day at the pool.
Is this to reduce  the citygate load or is this additional New Power supply?
