I would like to share with you a personal struggle I go through as the United Way contribution campaign rolls around each year.
First I would like commend the United Way as an organization that does help people in need in our community.
At the same time it funds the Boy Scouts of America, an organization with an explicit policy to discriminate against gays.
I know I can direct my contribution within United Way, but not until the United Way sees a drop in its total fund raising will it withdraw funding of the Boy Scouts of America.
I hope all involved in this effort understand why I and others choose not to contribute to the United Way and instead make direct contributions  to organizations that do not discriminate.
