Rod:  attached is a recap of current credit derivatives trading in Jeff K.'s  group.
I don't know about activity during Shari's oversight but I hear it  was minimal.
How does this compare with Enron Credit.com?
Also, do we want  agreements with other trading counterparties (e.g., DLJ Capital Funding,  Inc.)?
Are Jeff and Paul calling credit before trading?
Please call to chat  when you have a chance.
Thanks.
Sara
