Rebecca,  Philippe being the only other corp officer within the large technology  organization has an enormous volume of contracts to sign.
A large bulk of  the signatures that are required come from two areas;  Infrastructure and  ENA.
I would like to have 2 current Vice Presidents within the business  units made corp VPs:  Beth Pearlman and Jenny Rub.
Can we make this happen and when would it occur?
Thanks,
