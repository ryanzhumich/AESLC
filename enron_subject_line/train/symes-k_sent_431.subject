Following are the prices for fixed sales between EPMI Short Term California  and EES for 1/25.
Chris Mallory has turned this task over to me, and I'm  working from my own spreadsheet, which I inadvertently deleted this morning.
Please let me know if you'd like a copy of the spreadsheet as well as the  prices each morning, or if the prices are sufficient.
NP-15  On Peak - $273.50  Off Peak - $204.43  SP-15  On Peak - $216.53  Off Peak - $189.35  Thanks,
