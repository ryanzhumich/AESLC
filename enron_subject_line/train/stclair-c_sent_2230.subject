Phyllis: I spoke with Ed sacks, our credit person, about the form of LC that your  credit person circulated.
We both agreed that the LC form for the EEI Master  and the ISDA needs to be the form that we attached to the drafts that have  been sent to you given that the drawing conditions match the LC language that  is in each Master.
Please talk to your credit person about this and let me  know if this is okay.
