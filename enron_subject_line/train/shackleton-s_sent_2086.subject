John:  Hi, there!
As you are aware of the structuring for tax purposes,  until the U.K. corporate agent is actuallly formed, there is nothing further  that I can do.
That formation should happen today or tomorrow.
With the  actual name and agreements with ENA and ECT Investments, Inc., I can provide  that information to Instinet and the other trading platforms you are  interested in transacting on.
Just FYI, the Instinet people are merely  waiting for the agent agreement in order to proceed.
Please let me know if you have any further questions.
Sara
