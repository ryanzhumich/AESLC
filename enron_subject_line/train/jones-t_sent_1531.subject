Attached is a revised draft of the Authorized Trader List.
We need to open a  pulp & paper brokerage account today, so we will need to get this signed by  the end of the day.
Please let me know if Ted has any comments.
If not, I  will get it initialled and bring it to Ted for signature.
I am wating to  hear from Sara as to whether we should add agricultural to the list.
Per  Gary, the list will be the same exact list as financial.
Thanks!
