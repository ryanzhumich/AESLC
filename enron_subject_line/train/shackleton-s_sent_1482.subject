Mark:  I have scheduled a 5 pm flight to NO.
I am attending a wedding Friday  night.
I hope this is not a problem, but let me know.
Also, did you receive  my voice mail about the Goldman electronic agreement and their denial of my  request for injunctive relief upon proof of breach?
I'd like to finalize  this agreement.
Thanks.
Sara
