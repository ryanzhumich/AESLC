Hi guys,  Here's a suggested revision to the invoicing language.
Lee, I've asked the question about the other invoices.
If we don't get an  immediate answer, I think you can send the invoices to Ben, and we can  process them here.
I'm always happy to volunteer Ben.
By the way, I haven't  given Ben his signing party favor, as he hasn't been in Houston since we last  met.
