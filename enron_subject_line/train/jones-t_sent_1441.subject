Re: the Statoil Assignment  The Statoil master will not be terminated.
They sold their existing natgas &  crude oil book to J. Aron.
They may trade other products out of that master,  or it is possible they might want to enter into future trades in those  products.
So, the trades reflected in the assignment should be moved under  the J. Aron master.
Everything else should remain the same.
