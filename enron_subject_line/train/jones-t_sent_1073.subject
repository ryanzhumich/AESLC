As you both may recall, we left unresolved whether our intention was to have  the credit derivatives tied to the applicable ISDA Master Agreement, if there  was any.
Mark's first thought was that they would always go under a GTC, but  after reflection, perhaps we might want them to go under the master.
We need  to get this resolved because there is no global contract assigned to any of  the credit derivatives online, which is causing much trouble between Global  Contract and the online crew.
Can you direct me as to what our approach will be.
Thanks.
