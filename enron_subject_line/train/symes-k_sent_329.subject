The graphs I've set on your desks are the product of a new version of the EOL  Report.
Please look them over briefly and determine whether or not the data  this report pulled in is correct.
I've attached a table of the data as well  for another point of reference.
If there are problems or discrepancies in the  report, please let me know as soon as possible, and we'll adjust it  accordingly.
Thanks,
