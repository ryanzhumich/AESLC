I have attached the referenced spreadsheet, changing my product approvals to  add the new product list that Stephanie sent me (instead of th eold list  Credit sent me).
One of the new products appears to be Austrian physical  power.
Like the other European based physical power products, it should not  be opened for the US based credit counterparties to trade, so I will not be  marking it out on a going forward basis, I will just expect it to be shut  down for the US based counerparties (unless I tell you otherwise on a  particular one).
Is that OK with you.
Also, for Sempra, they will be coming by again on the 7/21 list (Credit  opened them up for all financial power).
I had already opened them up for  all financial products except weather, so it shouldn't affect my approval.
