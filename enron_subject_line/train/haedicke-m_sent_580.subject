The volume and complexity of our legal work has increased dramatically over  the past few years.
I think this environment requires additional time to be  devoted to legal planning and review in order to provide the best possible  service to our clients.
Within the next month, I have asked Janette to  schedule a Quarterly Legal Review for each group listed on our new  organizational chart .
I  would envision that we would focus on the  following:    review of the current monthly legal report and significant legal issues review of the top ten legal risks form contracts and other documentation projects legal budget legal resources, inside and outside performance metrics  In addition, I am proposing that any energy trading contract for a term  longer than one year by initialled by an AGC or member of the OGC.
Let me  know what you think about that.
