All:  I am trying to determine what issues are currently being addressed with  respect to MG London, Inc. from a U.S. regulatory perspective and WHO is  addressing them.
My concern arises from questions I am being asked by Gary  Hickerson's group regarding FX trading AND (agricultural) trading where the  existence of an Enron FCM or CTA could become significant.
I will try to  have a short call arranged so that we can all understand the planned course  of action, etc.
I realize that other individuals may be involved and we can  include them as necessary.
Thanks.
Sara
