I am forwarding for your attention the resume of Peter Percell who has an extensive experience in modeling physical flows  of natural gas in pipeline systems.
Peter is looking currently for a job.
I met him last week at the meeting of the Science and Industry Advance with  Mathematics society at the University of Houston.
The application of recent developments in optimization theory and numerical methods can help Enron to improve further  efficiency of our pipeline system and reduce the consumption of compressor  fuel.
Please, let me know if you interested in introducing Peter to executives in your organization.
I shall be glad to make arrangements for an interview.
