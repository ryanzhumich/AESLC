John: I understand from Tana Jones that we are going to try to put an ISDA in place  today.
We should be sending you the draft shortly.
Please call me directly  with any comments or questions that you may have.
Please pass the  information below  to anyone else that may be working on this from your end.
Thanks.
I look forward to hearing from you.
