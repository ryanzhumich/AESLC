Hi, Kristin.
I guess we got our wires crossed last Friday about lunch.
Sorry about that.
He told me that you guys have rescheduled for tomorrow  (Tuesday) at 12:30 p.m. and that you will meet him there.
I'll make a  reservation at Carrabas on Kirby in your Dad's name at that time.
Please let  me know if you have a conflict.
Thanks, SRS  PS - I also have you down for lunch with your Dad on Friday, November 10 - do  you have it down, too?
