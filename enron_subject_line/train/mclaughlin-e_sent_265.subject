Sue,  I am sending you this e-mail because I received your voice message well after  you left it today.
I reviewed the text files that are sent out by the book  administrators on my desks and none of them contain any deals booked to the  counterparty El Paso Gas Marketing.
All of the deals from people on my desk  are booked to the valid El Paso counterparty per our conversations.
I will be out of the office tomorrow, but I will be checking my voicemail  frequently and communicating with my group.
If the same problem arises  tomorrow, please call me at 713-305-1502 so that we can discuss, because  there has to be some other explanation for the erroneous counterparty showing  up on your report.
Thank you,
