PSC Staff has asked us to poll our active Marketers to determine who might be EDI compliant and has been utilizing EDI transactions such as enrollment, drop, historical information and current usage.
The goal here is to find suitable partners for testing EDI transactions that are scheduled to become effective at the end of this year.
If your company is currently actively using EDI and is interested in testing with KeySpan in the next several months, please forward me the proper contact person in your organization along with their telephone number.
Thank you.
Mike
