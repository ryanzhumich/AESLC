How are things going?
Learning lots?
Went to the rodeo and then to Nashville  North yesterday so feeling a little fuzzy today.
I'm not doing anything today  but tommorow I am going to the rodeo and then to a big industry party so that  should be good for a headache.
Friday I'm going to the Chick Wagon party and  Saturday to Nashville North with the boys.
Weather has been good and looks  like that will continue.
Did you find a gym yet?
