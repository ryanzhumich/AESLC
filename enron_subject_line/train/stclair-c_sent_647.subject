Rob: Enclosed is what I think should be the final form of the Schedules.
I have  made some clean-up chnages.
In the LC,.
my notes indicate that we were going  to keep the renewal language in.
Please let me know if this draft is okay  with you and then we will coordinate getting it executed.
Thanks for your  help.
Carol
