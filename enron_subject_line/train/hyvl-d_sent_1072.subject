Barbara,  Tom Martin called and said it was his understanding that he could buy gas at  any EOL point such as Exxon Katy, Waha or Carthage for any term and that he  could resell such gas into HPL.
I explained to him that the EOL carve out  was for transactions of less than one month.
He asked if you could call him  if his understanding was incorrect and then he asked if you wouldn't mind  just calling him to discuss the matter.
