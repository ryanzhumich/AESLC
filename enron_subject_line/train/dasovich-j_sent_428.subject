Gang:  I'm finalizing what we talked about yesterday and something struck me w.r.t.
siting reform.
One of our key messages in California and nationally is that price spikes are  due in no small part to outmoded, arcane siting rules and a shortage of power  as a result.
Price spikes have led to wholesale and retail price caps,  investigations, utility under-recovery, and threats of rolling back  de-regulation, to name a few.
Understanding that Dave raises some good points about why he's not thrilled  about getting involved in more siting reform bills, could someone argue that  from a corporate objective, getting a good siting reform bill passed this  session is a fairly high priority?
I'm not sure what the answer is, but it  struck me as I was pretty-ing up the document and I thought I'd put it out  there for reaction.
Best,
