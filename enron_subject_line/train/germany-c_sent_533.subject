As most of us are aware, Trasnco will be terminating all master commodity  contracts effective 9/1/2000.
I don't think we should make any changes to  the master contracts in our system until after the 1st.
However, we will  need start adding the demand contracts to the East and Market East in  Sitara.
Following is a list of master contracts and the associated demand  contracts effective 9/1/2000.
