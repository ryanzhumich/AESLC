Attached please find the referenced lists.
On the list of 3/12/01a, I have  not yet seen the list from Gobal Contracts with the corrected names, but I  cannot believe Lyke Corporation (also called Ripon Community Printers) is a  valid legal name.
We might want to get that sorted out before we start  trading with them.
