With respect to Commercial Risk Re-Insurance Company, a Bermuda company,  although they are being sent thru to specifically open them for weather,  Brent Hendry says I can't open them up until we review their Memorandum of  Association (like their articles of incorporation) to confirm that nothing in  them would prohibit this type of transaction.
Can you contact whomever sent  you the Password Application and ask them to fax their Memorandum of  Association to us.
Thanks!
