A heads up -  The Forward Obligation report for 3/28 will show Short Term Northwest with a  50 MWh short position off-peak at NP-15.
This is due to an option that Sean  and Diana decided not to exercise.
Thought that might clear up at least one  of the many discrepancies we may find on that report.....  Kate
