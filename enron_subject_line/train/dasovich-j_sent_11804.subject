Per our conversation, here's a copy of the curves that need updating.
If  possible, could you get them to me by tomorrow afternoon?
Sorry for the  rush.
Gotta talk on Thursday.
I want to superimpose on the curves the  rates  that Loretta just put in place for 500 KW and above (for Edison and  PG&E).
Can you do that if I get you the rates?
Thanks a million.
Best,
