Jeff,  Just a quick note to say "thank you" for your comments at year end.
I  sincerely appreciated your comments and support.
I hope your Holidays were safe, healthy, and happy.
Say when am I going to  see that new home of yours?
You know it is hard to continue to live  vicariously through you if I don't know what to picture!
Sandra
