In order to terminate the referenced agreement we need to provide notice 180 days in advance of the end of the primary term or any annual extension.
Based upon a May 1, 1997 in service date for the Havasu facililties, the primary term of this agreement terminates on April 30, 2002.
We need to provide notice by October 31, 2001 of our intent to trigger the ROFR process (see attached).
Please let me know if you have any questions.
