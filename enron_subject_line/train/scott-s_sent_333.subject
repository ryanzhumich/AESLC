I just received a copy of a Section 5 complaint filed by SoCal requesting a  FERC order 1) determining that the SoCalGas/Topock delivery point is fully  subscribed on a firm primary basis, 2) directing El Paso to comply with  previous Commission orders that preclude the selling of firm primary capacity  at points where none is available and 3) directing El Paso to schedule  capacity acquired during an open season (effective Jan. 1, 2000) into  SoCal/Topock on a secondary basis only.
SoCal states that it has experienced  daily cuts of up to 57% and averaging 25%.
If you would like a copy of the complaint, let me know.
