Prof. Bajaj.
Our understanding is that we'll need the electronic file you talked about on  Monday in order to do the first (optional) case (re: helpful questions and  spreadsheets).
But we haven't received the file yet.
Could you possibly  forward it to us?
We're leaning strongly toward writing the first case up  and turning it in and are anxious to get started.
Thanks very much.
Best,
