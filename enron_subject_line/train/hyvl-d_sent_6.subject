Dan,  I have attached the first draft of the Petrogulf Corporation purchase  agreement and gathering agreement.
As we discussed this morning, I have made  no mention to the Bear Paw issue.
Additionally, your proposal is to purchase  up to 10,000/d at NGPL (OK) Index.
Is the next item in error, it reads  "above 5,000 up to 80%".
I changed it to "above 10,000 up to 80%".
Please  review, I believe I incorporated all of your items in the form, if not,  please call and I will modify.
