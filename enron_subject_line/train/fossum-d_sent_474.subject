In case you haven't already marked your calendars, tomorrow will be my two  year anniversary with the company.
The good Lord willing (and with Stan's  and Mike's continued acquiescence) I may even surpass the tenure of my two  most recent and very illustrious predecessors.
Given your meteoric career  tracks, however, I'm not sure you guys would view that as a huge  accomplishment.
Hope all goes well with you both.
Adios from the big O.   DF
