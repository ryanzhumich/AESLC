Tanya: Some of the people in your group may not be aware of the latest forms that we  use for the Enron Guaranty, the Counterparty Guaranty and the letter of  credit form that we use for the ISDA, Omnibus, Industrial Master and Deemed  ISDA forms.
enclosed are those forms.
We will discuss them with the group  tomorrow, but could you circulate them to the group?
Alos, in light of all  of the counterparty visits taht are occurring, should we send to the group a  form of confidentiality agreement taht they can send to the counterparty?
The practice lately has been for us to see the counterparty form and our  preference would be to use our form.
Let me know what you think.
Carol
