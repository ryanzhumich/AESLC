Jeff, I think Risk can do two things to improve the process:  have more of us  involved in the process so they actually see the implications of booking  deals incorrectly and actively following up on recurring problems.
This last  one I am particularly bad about.
I will see a variance that is rather small  and just take it without looking into the underlying cause more carefully.
I  think the OA group in general should take a more active approach in  preventing problems rather than just identifying them.
But I know that is  easier said than done.
