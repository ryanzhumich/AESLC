Pat, thanks for the revisions to the AESOP language.
I have another one for  you.
The attached is a proposed retention program for persons in HR who may  be facing outsourcing.
There is a need to incentivize these key personnel to  stick around now and, if there is an outsourcing, to help with the  transition.
Your comments/thoughts would be appreciated.
Thanks.
Michelle
