I just got off the phone with Margaret Lester, a contract administrator at  Dynegy, and Harlan Murphy, an attorney she works with.
There was some  misinformation communicated to them about EOL, and I told them the only way  we would trade online with them was under the existing master, not under the  online GTCs, we wanted the bankruptcy protection the master affords.
They  want to replace the old ERMS Master with an ISDA and I told them we would be  happy to generate the master.
Can I get some credit from you so I can turn  around a master quickly, or we will have to work off their form, which will  then become an ISDA comparison which will be a lot more work in the long run.
Much thanks as usual for your prompt help!
