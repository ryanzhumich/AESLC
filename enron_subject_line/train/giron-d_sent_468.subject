Uncle Clark,  It just dawned on my that I never really thanked you for our visit.
All four  of us had a great time.
It was so good to see all of you and especially  great to see the kids get together and have so much fun.
I really regret  that as I was growing up, we really did not see that much of each other( and  by we, I mean the Kansas group and the Girons).
But even given that, I feel  as if you all have been part of my life and every time we get together it's  like we have always spent alot of time together.
I guess that's why they  call it family.
So once again, thanks for your hospitality and we look
