Frank,  After looking the packet over in detail, I found the questions to be a great  tool, especially the ones aimed at the 'soft skills'.
Previously when  interviewing people I always struggled for a way to ask these type of  questions legally and ethically.
I think the packet also will aid in my  organization and will keep the interview moving at an efficient pace.
Thanks,
