These deals were entered as flowing all days, and should have just been Mon -  Sat.
This was my fault, as I didn't know my computer defaulted to all days.
(This has since been fixed!)
I've changed them in the system and was told to  let you know so you can re-confirm the deals with just on-peak days.
Sorry  about the hassle.
I promise I'll get the hang of this soon!
Thanks,
