Hi Steph, I don't know if this question should go to you.
If not, please  forward it on to the right person and let me know who that is.
The reservation volumes on the seasonal contracts do not look correct.
The  demand charge looks OK, its the demand volume which is not calculating  correctly.
And ENA has released this capacity to Energy Express effective  June 1.
Please look at the following contracts/deals.
