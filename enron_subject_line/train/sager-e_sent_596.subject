Attached is the final version of the Standstill Agreement that Larry Witalis  and I have been working on.
As has been discussed, the Standstill Period  would be until June 20th, the LCs would be extended until June 29th and the  draw condition re 20 day expiry would be deleted.
Please review the attached and let me know if this would be OK to execute  tomorrow and send to PG&E for signature.
Bill -  please confirm the amounts of the LCs.
Thanks
