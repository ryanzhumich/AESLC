Trena:  In the next week or so, I will be devoting most of my time and  attention to Gary's world.
I met with Gary last week, and he suggested that  I give you a call to see if you needed any legal assistance.
I am available  for whatever you might need me for.
My number in Houston is 713/853-5620.
I'm looking forward to working with you.
Regards.
Sara
