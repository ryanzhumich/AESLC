Edmund -   I have reviewed the long descriptions I was given for the credit derivatives  (I can't tell if they are current) and have substantial comments - I have  attached what I have come up with (sorry it's in 2 pieces).
Basically I  don't think we should be restating something in the Long Description that is  already covered (sometimes with different language) in the GTC - this only  creates an ambiguity and is not necessary to form a complete contract.
My  other concern - and I have not been able to draft language to fix it - is  that I can't find any definition of the Seller Payment amount and I don't  think the Buyer Payment language works  -  can you give me a call so we can  discuss my concerns?
