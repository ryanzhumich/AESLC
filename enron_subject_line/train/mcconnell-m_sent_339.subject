Joe,    I have been reading about ePower and potentially building sites.
I know you  are clarifying it's activities but until then, I have instructed my guys to  respond to ePower when they call and to discuss events (e.g.
:  possible LNG  re-gas plans for ePower) but to make sure and discuss all activities with you  as well.
Let me know if you want something different or want me to email other  instructions.
Thanks,
