Jim:  In connection with our disussion regarding Market Quotation and "Reference  Market - makers" in the Schedule (specifically Enron's request to delete  clause (b) to the Section 12 definition), I am advised that it would be  difficult to locate four leading dealers with offices in the same city.
With  respect to the outstanding trades, for example, we would like to know which  city has  four leading dealers  for quoting Mid-Columbia prices?
Please let  us know.
Thanks.
Sara
