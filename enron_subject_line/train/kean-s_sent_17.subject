There may be some press today about Enron's involvement in the Nepal hydro  project.
The government of Nepal is hopeful that we will pursue it, but we  are not going to.
Kelly's response on press inquiries will be that we are  not pursuing the project.
Kelly will also be getting in touch with David  Howe.
I just wanted to keep you guys posted in case you are getting  questions.
