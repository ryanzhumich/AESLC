Nice job on the photos.
Really makes me realize how drunk I was at certain  times.
The good thing is that the "Dude" I met in Joe's and I are now pen  pals and he will be coming to Houston to visit very soon.
Maybe he was my  long lost brother.
I am making a phone call to my Mom right now too see if  she has anything she wants to explain to me.
