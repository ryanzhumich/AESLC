I am negotiating an ISDA on behalf of ENA with an Australian corporate  insisting upon a legal opinion (enforceability) with respect to the Enron  Corp. guaranty.
Is this a customary request by Australian corporates that  you would normally grant?
If so, who has issued the opinion?
I look forward  to your reply.
Regards.
Sara
