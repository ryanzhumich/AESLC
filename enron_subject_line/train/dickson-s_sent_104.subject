Rae,   I am not sure if Jeff Hodge has already volunteered me.
If he has not, I  would like to volunteer to be on the drafting committee.
I am not available  May 29th through June 1st.
Otherwise, I can make myself available whenever  the drafting committee meets.
Thank you,

@subject
Drafting Committee for the Contracts Sub-Committee
