Just wanted to keep you posted on this deal.
You called me earlier and said  that the counterparty, Deseret, had recorded this deal with Enron buying.
We  entered the deal with Enron selling.
I have Matt Motley, Kim Ward, and Tim  Belden reviewing the tapes of Kim Ward's conversation with Desret last week,  in which it is clear that she was selling to Deseret.
She's spoken with her  contact there, who still disputes the deal and says we were buying.
They're  all talking it over right now, and I'll let you know as soon as we make a  decisiion on whether or not to change this deal.
Thanks for your patience,
