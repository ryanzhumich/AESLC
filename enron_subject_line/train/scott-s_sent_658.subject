Just to forewarn you two, it looks like Darren (Ted's buddy) is going to be  in London for a few months working on a project.
When I mentioned you two  were both over there right now he asked me for your email addresses.
No  pressure for you guys to do anything with him, but I do like the guy and  think when I come over we will definitely have to do something with him (and  Nick too of course...maybe the same night, that whole "kill two birds with  one stone concept").
Sue  Side-note:  I'm am dying of curiosity as to why Darren is going to London for  a project and Ted is trading corn here.
Maybe I'll find out before Darren  leaves.
Who knows, maybe if you all see Darren over there you can find out  what the heck happened with our once so promising Mr. Noble.

I've go a new ex-pat for you guys...
