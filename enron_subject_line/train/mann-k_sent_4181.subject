Question for the team:  If it appears that we may have land which may not be able to stay off balance  sheet, is it preferable to have the land held by a different LLC than the  project LLC, with a lease to the E-Next/OBS compliant project co?
If that is the case, what about the possibility of burdening the land with  some low dollar hard costs?
I don't have anything in particular in mind, it  is more of a theoretical question.
Thanks,
