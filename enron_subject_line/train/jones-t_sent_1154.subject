Attached please find referenced list.
A few notes:  No physical power or credit derivatives for any of these Japanese  counterparties.
Re:  Bandwidth, as a general principle, what I'm hearing  from the bandwidth lawyers is (1) for Japanese counterparties they can only  trade the U.S. segment (which is currently the only segment we have online),  and (2) for right now, we have 1 Netherlands and 2 German counterparties on  the list, and they are still checking to get the scoop on those countries, so  for right now I am shutting them down for bandwidth.
