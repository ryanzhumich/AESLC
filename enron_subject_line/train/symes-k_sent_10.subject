In reviewing Jeff Shields' expenses for the previous two months, I have found  two travel itineraries which came without prices on them.
Jessica and Mollie  have both checked their e-mail and confirmed that the only documents sent did  not detail the cost of the trip.
The prices I need are from the following trips:  Itinerary only - August 28, Alaska Airlines, PDX-SeaTac-Helena-SeaTac-PDX,  Reservation # AS/WXOKNK  (reservation made August 24) Itinerary only - Sept. 6 to 7, Delta Airlines, PDX-Salt Lake  City-Spokane-PDX, Reservation # DL/V2KIC3  (reservation made September 6)  Thank you so much for your time.
