According to Cliff Shedd, we would be covered by insurance if we terminated  the contract with Furnas and Furnas failed to pay the termination payment.
However the insurers will only pay after we receive an arbitration judgement  against them and the refuse to honor the judgement.
I assume we would also  have to exhaust our remedies against trhe guarantor (Eletrobras).
Also, we are required to notify the underwriters immediately of a material  default.
