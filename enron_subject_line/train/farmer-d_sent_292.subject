Nagesh,   Please resort the pipeline order on the Texas/HPLC position screen in CPR.
The current sort makes it difficult for us to manage our trading position  each day.
The arrangement  (from the top of the screen to the bottom) that  would most benefit us is listed below:  Houston Pipe Line East Texas Gas System NNGB Oasis PG&E Valero All remaining pipes listed in alphabetical order by pipe name.
Please look into this and let me know of any problems in making these changes.
Thanks.
