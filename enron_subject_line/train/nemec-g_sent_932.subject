One more revision to the GTC.
Few changes based on my discussion with Carl  this morning.
I have attached a clean and redlined copy.
The redline is  compared against the version prior to the secondary point discussion for  Colleen's benefit.
I am fine to run with this copy from a legal perspective  unless Dick or Colleen had any comments.
