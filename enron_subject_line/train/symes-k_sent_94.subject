Jeff has both sides of both deals in the system correctly.
Here are the deal  numbers.
461029 Williams 115.00  461030 EES 114.95  461801 Mieco 115.00  461802 EES 114.95  And Deal #461139 was actually a Short Term Southwest deal done by Tom Alonso  with Williams for the same price on the same days, but with Prebon.
Confusion!
Hope this fixes it.
