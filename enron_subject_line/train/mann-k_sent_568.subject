I'm hearing rumblings about the need to perform various preliminary tasks  (survey work, etc.).
I've given the admonition to avoid incurring hard costs  until the financing/accounting treatment has come together.
That lead to the  question of what is a hard cost.
I know construction/equipment obligations  are problems, studies generally ok.
This leads me to the conclusion that a  geotechnical survey would be ok.  Am I safe here?
Thanks,
