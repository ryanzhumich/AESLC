adele: Just wanted to get back to you regarding the one remaining issue on the ISDA  Schedule.
With respect to Section 7 - Transfer, we would like to keep the  original language.
We view the "credit rating" language as a one time  exception which if we need to we can deal with separately, but any subsequent  transfers after that we want to use the more generic language.
Can we set up  a call to discuss this and my other comments which I sent to you?
Let me  know some times this week that work for you.
Thanks.
