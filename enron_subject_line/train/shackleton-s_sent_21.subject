Attached is a redraft of your letter.
RMT knows nothing about the execution  or termination of any collar between Elektro and WestLB (since RMT was not a  party to that transaction).
Also, we have been unable to internally trace the  source of the $387,250.00 received by RMT.
We are trying to trace this  through Chase and expect an answer on Thursday (if we're lucky).
Otherwise,  call me about the letter.
Sara
