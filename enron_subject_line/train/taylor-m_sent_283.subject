I currently have a 28800 modem but would like to get the fastest (within  reason) modem we have available for a Compaq LTE 5280.
Please let me know if  this is the kind of thing I can get by Friday since I leave for London Friday  afternoon and would like to take the computer (complete with modem) with me.
If the new modem is not available in that time frame, I at least need a new  pigtail for the existing card since the old one is broken.
Thanks and please charge 413/1157.
