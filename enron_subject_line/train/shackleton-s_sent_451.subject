Hello there!
Hope all is well.
Will you be at the legal conference later  this month?
Would you please provide us with information identifying the specific entity  requiring the brokerage account and a brief description of the transaction  for which the account is required.
Also, for purposes of your unanimous  consent or resolution,  you should note that either of Ted Murphy or Rick Buy  should be one of the two signatories required for opening the account.
Let  me know if you have any questions.
Sara
