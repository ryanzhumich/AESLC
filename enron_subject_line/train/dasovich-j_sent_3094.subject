Mike, Jeanne: Have you heard anything about any relief on penalties that the PUC might have  recently granted interruptible customers?
(Recall that Loretta has refused  to allow folks on interruptible to get off those contracts.)
Could you let  me know as soon as you find something out?
Thanks.
Best,
