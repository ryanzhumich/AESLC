I have reviewed the pro-forma May 17, 2000 draft of the Gas Purchase Contract provided to you by the subject party.
The only item that has to be changed is the second sentence of 22.2 relating to venue in Cook County, Illinois.
This sentence needs to be deleted.
Enron would prefer to be the confirming party in sections 2.2 and 2.3; however, that is our preference but we can agree to let the other party be the confirming party when necessary.
Please get with your counterparty and let me know how you would like to proceed.
