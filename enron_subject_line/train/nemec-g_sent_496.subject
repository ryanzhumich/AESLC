Bruce,  How is it going?
Are you still having problems working in your  room?
Its like psssst, I am out.
I have a couple of letters at the house for you.
I can forward wherever you  like.
Things are going fine for me.
I cry myself to sleep every night  screaming out Bruce, Bruce why did you leave me?
Drop me a line and let me know how it is going.
Also do you have Tristan's  phone number?
Wanted to give him a call and see if he wanted to grab some  beers now and then.
