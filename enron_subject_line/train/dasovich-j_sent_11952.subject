Greetings;  I've tried to accommodate everyone's comments, but there's still a hole or  two.
In addition, seems that the letter would benefit from a bit more  editing to make it shorter.
Richard, note that I've left a place holder in  the opening paragraph to fill in a summary of our arguments and the  conditions under which we'd be willing to produce certain documents.
Best,
