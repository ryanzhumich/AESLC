I plan to work out of the London office during the week of January 15.
I  will leave Houston on Sunday and will be in the London office starting around  noon on Monday.
I will be back in the Houston office on Monday, January 22.
The primary goals of the trip are:    to work with Mike Jordan on an action plan to move the close and  officialization of London books to same  day,   to replicate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts  (we are doing this in Houston  on January 11 per my e:mail to you for  managers and above within Operations),   to hold a training session for business controllers in the London office who  will participate in Doorstep   reviews this year (outside EEL),    to discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London  office related to speeding up  London's information for the corporate DPR   Patti Thompson (x39106) will have a detailed itinerary in hand if you need  to reach me at any time next week.
