Hey Ashley,  Just thought I'd drop you a line to let you know that I will be in London  this Friday through next Tuesday.
I'm visiting a friend of mine who is  attending Sotheby's graduate program.
I know it's short notice, but I would  love to see you at some point while I'm over there.
If you get a chance  email me back and let me know if you're free any of those days and how I can  get a hold of you while I'm over there.
Hope all is well.
Susan
