Stacy: I left on your chair the commnets to the amendment agreements.
Could you  please confirm with Lisa that it makes sense to have the additional  bankruptcy termination enevts as "automatic" triggers in your document when  in the fianncial master it is drafted as an election.
Please e-mail the  revised agreement to KCS' counsel - Zachary May and copy Harry Stout.
Zachary's e-mail is zachary.may@weil.com and Harry Stout's is  hls@KCSEnergy.com.
Thanks and call me if you have any questions.
Carol
