Hi Mary.
Barbara tells me there's a better-than-good chance you will be  coming back to join the department.
Hooray!
I was hoping we could chat  about how you would feel about joining the financial trading group this time  around.
I'm leaving for the airport in just a bit to head out of town for  the rest of the week but would be happy to talk when I get back and you  should feel free to talk to Carol and Sara in the meantime.
