I've talked to Lee Ferrell about this, and it sounds to me like there are  serious business reasons (i.e., cost and functionality) not to use the ENA  system.
THe "sharing of resources" issue worries me, but might be solvable  if the right people are in Networks instead of ENA.
I'll call you tomorrow.
