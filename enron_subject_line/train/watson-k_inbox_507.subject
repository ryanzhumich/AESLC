The legal description for the proposed Southern Trails interconnect north of the Blanco Hub is Sec.
13, T29N, R11W, San Juan County, NM.
This is on the old NWPL receipt line coming off the 30" Ignacio - Blanco line into the Blanco Hub upstream of the El Paso Blanco measurement.
Bottom line is it's the same place we talked about earlier this week.
