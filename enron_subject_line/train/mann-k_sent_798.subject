This is a very rough draft based on an agreement done previously with a jv  company.
I'm sending it for Enron review only, since I haven't even read the  entire thing yet.
I thought you might want to take a look at it to see what  you think, and to consider the scope of the services to be provided.
As for legal services, one alternative would be to have the services provided  by an outside law firm, not associated with either principal.
Could you forward me what you received from Clement regarding the corporate  guaranty issue?
I would like to see what's the latest in that regard.
Thanks,
