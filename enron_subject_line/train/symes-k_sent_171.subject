I was just told that we are being sent the Credit Watchlist Update via fax,  in addition to the one you send me via e-mail every couple weeks or so.
Since  I already receive and print out the list for all of our traders and  mid-marketers, I thought it might cut down on some work for someone if they  didn't have to fax it to us as well.
I don't know if that person is you, or  if you might know who I can contact; in any case, Iwe don't need the  watchlist faxed to the Portland office.
(Anything to take one extra step out  of the day, right?)
Please let me know if I should contact somebody else.
Thanks so much,
