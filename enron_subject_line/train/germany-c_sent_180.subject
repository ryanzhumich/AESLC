We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday, off of Texas Gas  and CGLF.
We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.
I  will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.
Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.
I am currently using a CPR  Storage deal ticket and I believe that is incorrect.
I will let everyone  know the deal tickets by the end of the day.
