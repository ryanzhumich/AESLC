Marie is updating her list and preparing a general memorandum in connection  with the brokerage and futures agreements.
I have the following times  available to meet (and I think we should schedule about an hour):  Thursday between 1:30 and 3:15 Friday   after 10 am  Please let me know as soon as possible of your preference and I'll try to  accommodate everyone.
Thanks.
Sara
