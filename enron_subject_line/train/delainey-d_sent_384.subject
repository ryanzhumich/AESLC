Guys, this is my first cut on who I would want to be in this group.
I think  this is an important exercise on a couple different fronts.
We need to bring  more people "in" which should increase their accountability for ENA results  overall, improve communication and teamwork and provide a platform to  evaluate future leaders.
Trading   Origination  Country Managers  Support   Executive    Belden    Dietrich   Milnthorp   Colwell    Frevert  Presto    Calger   Yzaguirre   Beck    Delainey  Arnold    Duran       Oxley    Lavorato  Neal    Bowen       Haedicke     Shively    Donahue      Murray     Allen    Mrha            Martin    Redmond  I would like to send out a note this week to communicate whatever we come up  with in order to have the right folks available on Friday.
Look forward to your comments.
Regards
