Help me...I don't understand this LME Contract.
Mark says that even though  we trade it on EOL and the trade is still done directly with us, it is still  considered an LME contract, and not a lookalike.
I think I might need to  talk to you about this tomorrow, because I'm confused.
Also, I am getting a lot of calls from the MG people in New York about  pursuing metals counterparties, and I think we need to figure out whether  they should be talking to Houston or London Legal...I'm not sure who their  lawyers should be...also, the online team here in Houston is pursuing their  business, and it's not clear to me if I should also be having them call you  about potential metals customers?
Anyway, when I get in can I give you a call?
Also, I left a voicemail for your assistant, I'm trying to track down  Edmund's address so I can send him a gift, but no response?
Do you know when  he'll be back, or how I can get in touch with him?
