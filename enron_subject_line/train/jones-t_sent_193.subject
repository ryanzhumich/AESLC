Peter,  We revised the incumbency certificates for our U.S. master swap agreements to  include the authority of the officer as well as the officer's incumbency.
I made the same changes to the Canadian form, but don't want to make any  final changes to the Canadian form without your approval.
When you get a  minute can you take a look at it and see if the change meets with your  approval.
Nella, I am enclosing the current form of certificate as well as the revised  one (which is #1 documents below).
Can you print them out for Peter.
Thanks!
