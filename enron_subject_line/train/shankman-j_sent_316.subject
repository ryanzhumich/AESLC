I believe Greg W. is coming to talk to you today about this new business.
Further to this, I'd like to ask again how I can get access to VAR  (I  believe Lavorato and Sherriff have $5 million they each keep upstairs and  allocate to their businesses as needed temporarily).
Is this a Board  question, or do you have the authority to allocate this VAR to me?
On another note, I've been helping Bill Bradford with PGE exposure issues.
If you too need my help, let me know.
Thanks for your help...
