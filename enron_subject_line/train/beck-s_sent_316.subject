I have been able to move up the meeting with Mark Frevert regarding  responsibility for operations for ENA, EGM and EEL to Thursday, August 17  instead of August 28.
I will keep you posted.
I met with Brent's direct reports yesterday afternoon and announced Brent's  new role.
I will have three persons leading the natural gas team:  Steve  Jackson, Leslie Reeves and Bob Hall.
I am confident that this will work  well.
