Jeff: We have received a request from the above counterparty to alter the format of  the confirmation process on physical and financial deals.
In lieu of signing  each confirm that is sent to them, what they want to send back to us is a  letter signed by them in which they describe the confirm and indicate whether  or not they accept or disagree with the terms thereof and if they disagree  with such terms, they will return the confirm.
Are you okay with this  procedure?
