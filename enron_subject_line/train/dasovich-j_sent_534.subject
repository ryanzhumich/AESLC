Rebecca Smith called.
She wants to have coffee on Monday at 10 AM  California.
Topics:  1) How California got here.
2) How California can get  out of it.
Any chance of talking Monday AM prior to 10 AM California time?
I think I've  got the messages pretty well down, but might be useful to touch base.
Let me  know.
Hear's a message I'm practicing:  "Shapiro and Steffes went to FERC on Friday----problem solved."
