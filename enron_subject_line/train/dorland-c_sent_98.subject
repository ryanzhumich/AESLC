Margaret,  Just wondering how my Visa was coming along?
I had a confusing conversation  with Jeanne in relocation services this morning.
The way I understand the  moving process is that my household goods have to leave Canada at the same  time or after I leave the country.
She seemed to think that I had to go to  the US and then return to Canada before my goods could leave Canada.
Can you  shed some light on this?
Thanx,
