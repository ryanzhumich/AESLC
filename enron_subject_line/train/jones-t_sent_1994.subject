It appears that we have now opened up our first Japan based financial product  on EnronOnline, and I need to get some direction from you as to what  restrictions, if any, we have on (1) counterparties located/incorporated in  Japan trading Japan based financial products, and (2) counterparties not  located in Japan trading Japan based financial products.
Previously, the only Japanese financial product we had was weather, but it  wasn't being sold by a Japan based Enron company, so my understanding was  that I didn't have any particular restrictions under Japanese law for  counterparties located in or outside Japan in trading this product.
Now that  the product is being sold by a Japan based company I am wondering was  restrictions I might have to keep in mind when doing my daily online  approvals.
The only are Japan based direction I am getting is from the Broadband legal  team (Robbi Rossi) which have told me Japanese counterparties can only trade  US bandwidth segments.
P.S.
we do have a Japanese counterparty on the 9/26/00 list.
