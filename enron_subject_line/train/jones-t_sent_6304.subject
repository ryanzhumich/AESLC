I've got everyone's access submitted except Martin Rosell and Anna Reich and  Oliver Harrison whose company codes and cost centers I will need.
Justin,  Mark Illiott, Robert Quick and Paul Simons already had edit access into the  database and does your assistant Nicola Beales who should be checking that  when she approves counterparties for EnronOnline (although I don't think the  UK agreement are currently up-to-date, although they need to be for  EnronOnline, it will save her a lot of time).
I'm a little worried about your Credit people making changes.
When you  approve Credit people, warn them that they are should not make any changes  except to Credit comments.
Edmund will need to go in and add your Legal and Credit people to the  Database Keywords as only he should have access to add Keywords.
You might  want to get him started on that because you have a lot of people to add.
It's taken me quite a bit of time get all these approvals done!
