Hey,  I checked out the Houston Chronicle website and there were two Preludes that  would be comparable to mine.
One was advertised for $21,995(which is the  blue book) and the other was advertised for $18,900ish.
Of course both were  being sold by dealers, so I probably couldn't get quite that much.
But I can  probably get enough to make it worthwhile to go ahead and sell my car.
I  just wonder how long it would take before it actually sold.
That's what I've accomplished since lunch.
Talk to ya later, Robin
