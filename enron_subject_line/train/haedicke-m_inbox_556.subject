I know there is lots going on but I would like to resign from the Board of Mariner asap.
I am having trouble devoting enough time to this function and feel it would be better if I turned it over to someone else.
Dave Gorte in my group would be my recommendation as a replacement.
If Dave does not have an interest, Brad Larson could also fill in.
Any thoughts?
If you have no issues I will proceed.
Thanks, Rick
