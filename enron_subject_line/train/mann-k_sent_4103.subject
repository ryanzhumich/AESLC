Hi Kara,  Michael has been seeing a speech/language therapist, and recently she raised  an issue about Michael's ability to "blend and unblend" sounds in words,  specifically as it relates to reading readiness.
She had this conversation  with Neil, so I don't know the details.
We are meeting with her today to get  more input, but I wanted to mention it to you, just in case you had a comment.
I know this is something we can discuss at Michael's conference on May 31st,  but if you would like to discuss it before hand, I can be reached at 713 304  8716 9 (cell), 713 345 -7566 (office - just tell my asst you are Michael's
