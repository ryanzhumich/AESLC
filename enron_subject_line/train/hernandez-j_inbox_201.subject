A quote from Pennsylvania Ave.:  "This is pretty serious!"
This was just received from the DOE and pertains particularly to DOE and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) facilities:  "DOE/NNSA is at SECON 3 with additional measures designed to detect and deter vehicular-borne explosives.
Effective immediately, and until further notice, all DOE/NNSA activities shall add measures to their current heightened state of readiness designed to deter terrorist attacks by visibly increased perimeter security and security checks.
Change in routines, including institution of random measures, shall also be implemented."
Thank you,
