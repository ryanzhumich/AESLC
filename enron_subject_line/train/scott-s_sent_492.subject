Well, given the impressive results of Friday's game, I suppose I should've  taken the bet...I mean I knew we were good, but I didn't realize we were THAT  good.
Watching the game I couldn't help but remember some comments made not  too long ago about this being a building season and that the Horns would be a  force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons - - I love it when I'm  right.
With an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the  charge and three (count them three) very mature freshman receivers all eager  to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit Chance  Mock serving as a back-up, next season promises to be something to watch.
My  condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright .
Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving and good luck helping all of your Aggie  co-workers through this trying time.
Susan  (Oh and Chip, I'd store the Gig'em sweater-vest away for the next 360 days or  so if you want to avoid any post-game ridicule...in a round about way you are  an "Ag" man now.)
