Can you met with Ella's school sometime mid morning on either Wed or Thurs  next week.
On Colorado, we currently are scheduled to return on Wed the 22nd.
On this  schedule we would miss parent orientation (Tues) and the kids would miss the  first day of school which is a half day (Wed).
Reschedule?
