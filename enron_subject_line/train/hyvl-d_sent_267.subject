Cary,  Jeff Hodge asked that I incorporate the agreed to items from their request  which was forwarded to Jeff by Gregg Penman on January 18, 2001 into a  document.
I have taken the document that Jeff forwarded to Sherry Brinkman  on December 7, 2000 and included the acceptable changes that Jeff indicated  were acceptable in his email to Gregg Penman on January 18, 2001.
If this is  your understanding, please let me know what else needs to be done to finalize  the documents.
