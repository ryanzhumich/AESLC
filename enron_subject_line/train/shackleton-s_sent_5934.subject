Yair:  Attached is a blacklined (against the Enron North America Corp. draft of  3/15/01) Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.
I have  tried to incorporate the essence of the March 19, 2001 "swap side letter  agreement."
Please call me to discuss as it would be nice to finalize by  April 6.
Thanks.
