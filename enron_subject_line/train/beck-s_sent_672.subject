FYI:  Effective today, the schedulers for HPL have relocated from the 42nd floor to  the 30th floor.
This team reports to my direct report, Brenda Herod, who is  the Business Controller for the Asset Group and Texas trading region.
They  are on the west side of the building, just outside my office.
While room for  this scheduling team was not available on the 31st floor, this move was made  to improve communications with the Texas desk traders.
By being within the  same elevator bank, we can now employ "squawk" boxes between the traders and  this scheduling team.
As we look at space usage on the 32nd floor, this team  should be included in space requirements.
We are working with Liz Taylor on  those requirements.
