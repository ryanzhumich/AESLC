I am confirming my conversation with you yesterday and my conversation a  minute ago with Lori Volpi at Dynegy Canada.
As we discussed, Dynegy Canada  is trading with both ECC and ENA, with the bulk of its trading being done  with ECC.
Instead of getting two ISDA Master Agreements in place, we will  enter into an ISDA Master Agreement between ECC and Dynegy Canada, and then  just back-to-back any ENA trades down to Houston by virtue of the Services  Agreement for Financial Agreements we have in place between ECC and ENA.
Per my conversation with Lori, this will also work with the EOL trades since  the Electronic Trading Agreement provides that any financial trades done for  either ECC or ENA will be transacted under the respective master agreement in  place with either ECC or ENA.
Works for me...!
