Susan,  Attached is the completed book request form.
I just want to clarify a few  things.
The first three books are for Tagg.
The last two are for Sitara.
I  will need a region set up in CPR to hold the physical deals.
Do you do  this?
Or can you point me in the right direction.
I really need this  completed by the end of the week.
Let me know if there is something else I  need to do.
Thanks for your help.
