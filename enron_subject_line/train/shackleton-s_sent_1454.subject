Carol:  I missed this deal the other day which was originally assigned to  Marie.
In our last legal/credit meeting, Brant was going to call Christina  Tice, the CP credit manager.
Maybe this is a good one for Tana to stay on  top of Brant.
Your name is on this one.
Also, nothing happened with credit on Friday.
Although Richard inquired  about Palladium.
I let him know that we drew on the LC's last week  (according to Tanya).
