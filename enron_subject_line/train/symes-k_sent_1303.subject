Thanks for letting me know about the change in this deal.
I looked at the  audit viewer, and it jogged my memory a bit.
Mike originally entered this  deal as Q2 off peak; then he came over to me the next day and said it should  have been Cal'03-Cal'04.
So we changed it, and it must have messed up the  strips somehow.
Anyway, if it checks out with the broker, that sounds good  enough for me.
Thanks again,
