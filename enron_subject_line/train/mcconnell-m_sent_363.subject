Jeff, attached is an expanded 1st draft of the memo.
I would like to keep  this expanded format to show the progress that we have made in the group.
Please make any changes and send back for the next round.
After we both look  at it 1 more time, we will circulate to the heads of the group for  commentary.
I would like to have them feel part of the memo.
Mike
