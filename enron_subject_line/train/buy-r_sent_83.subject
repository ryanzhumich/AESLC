The Board meeting has concluded and I can now focus on the task force.
The  following people in RAC have been assigned to this effort as follows:  Legacy Opportunity  Molly Harris Teresa Seibel James Copeland Michael Tribolet Jay Hachen Minal Dalia Don Rollins Rick Carson Jeff Soo Debbie Brackett Sue Vasan  On Going Opportunities  Denise Fury Mark Wilson Dana Smith Andrew Greer Martin O'leary Jay Hachen Dave Gorte Darren Schmidt Vladi Gorny David Port Jeff Soo  This is a huge commitment of staff from RAC and will strain us no end, but it  is necessary.
If you want RAC to lead this effort I will appoint Michael  Tribolet to manage the task.
If you want someone else to manage the  effort  we will assist as we can.
Regardless of who leads this effort we need  following:  Commitment of EES back office staff people  Commitment of IT resources Commitment of Skilling to fund the overage to the RAC budget, which I am  under huge pressure to reduce, not increase.
Let me know how to launch this program.
Rick
