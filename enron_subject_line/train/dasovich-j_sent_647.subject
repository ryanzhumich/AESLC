Greetings:  Well, there's a finance midterm coming up and some of us have discussed  getting together the weekend before for a study session.
I just grabbed an old list from last year so apologies if I've included folks  who ain't even in finance, or if I've left some folks off.
Sorry to those  who received in error, and please forward to anyone else who might be  interested.
Anyway, anyone interested?
Hope all is well with all.
Best,

Study?
