Can you set up a mid for all deals at a location of NBPL/Peoples and  PGLC/NBPL.
The intramonth curve Chi./N/Border and the gas daily curve is  GDC-Chi./N/Bord.
Can you tell me how many deals are currently in the system  for these two locations.
Sorry to rush you, but I need these in for calcing  tonight.
Thanks.
PL 3-7376
