I extended deal 559947 (Pool sale) thru the 31st, a volume of 27935 per day.
I changed storage deal 456379 from 196985 to 46985 on the 31st ONLY!!
Joann,  for Jan, we are selling New Power 31,679 out of the pool and 25893  from other sources (AO6, Broad Run, Delmont, and Monclova - this includes the  AO6 they are buying from us).
Which means we should only have 3844 out of  the pool.
Actually the citygate and storage should be as follows  Vol Comment 3844 Out of the pool 25893 Other receipt supply xxxx Storage - and this should match whats on the storage ticket.
