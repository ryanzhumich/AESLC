All:  During the fourth quarter, 2000, MLB intends to transfer all FX  business to MLIB Ltd.  ENA and Enron Corp. have been asked to agree to this  transfer with the result that any executed master agreement with MLB will be  transferred to MLIB Ltd as principal.
ENA has an ISDA Master Agreement dated  effective 7/1/95; I cannot locate a master between Enron Corp. and MLB.
Will someone in credit approve this transfer?
Please let Stephanie Panus  (X53249), our newest paralegal, know.
Thanks.
