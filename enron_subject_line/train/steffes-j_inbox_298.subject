Attached for your initial review are Enron Corp. comments on the Marketing Affiliate NOPR (RM01-10).
As you will see, this is an incomplete, bare bones version and we can enhance the arguments once it is clear we all agree with them.
Leslie has struggled mightily with this in light of the constant changes that have been going on and we are sure more changes will be necessary.
Comments must be filed at FERC by December 20.
In order to allow adequate time for a couple of redrafts and the concomitant reviews along with the other things that are going on, please advise me or Leslie of any suggestions, concerns or comments you have by COB MONDAY, NOVEMBER 26th.
