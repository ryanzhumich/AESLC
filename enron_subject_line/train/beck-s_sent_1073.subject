Patti will send you on Monday a draft of a memo regarding publishing the DPR  during the holidays.
Please review it and make sure that the commitments we  are making can be met by London.
Let me know if anything needs to be changed  or if there is further clarification needed in the notes, keeping in mind  that with the audience on the memo that I want it to be short and easy.
Your  comments/suggestions are welcomed and needed before I send this out later  next week.
Thanks.
