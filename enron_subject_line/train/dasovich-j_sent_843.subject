Harry:    Seems like a good idea for you to participate to ensure that EES is in the  loop.
Assemblyman Rod Wright's trying to find a solution that the whole  industry can embrace, which he'd then foist on the Governor.
Sandi, Parquet  and Day attended the first meeting last week.
I'll forward to you Parquet's  notes from the meeting.
We'll be setting up a call in number first thing  Monday morning.
Best,
