The fees that we charge for marketing EES has been revised and will take effect 10/4/01.
The new fees are as follows:  	1-100mw's=$3 fee 	100-200mw's=$4 fee 	over 200mw=$5 fee  Please note that if we market 101mw's for EES then we charge them $4 on the whole 101mw's for a total fee of $404.
Also if we were to market 201mw's for them then the total fee would be $1005 dollars.
In other words if they go over a the limit on one fee then we charge them the higher fee on all the mw's.
thanks,
