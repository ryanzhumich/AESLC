I am scheduled to be in NYC and Danbury, Connecticut as of tomorrow  afternoon, through the remainder of the week.
I'm assisting with the  negotiation of a contract for the purchase of fuel cells.
This is a Jeff  Ader/Ozzie Pagan/Heather Kroll deal.
Don't know if you guys like to keep up with such things, but I'm glad to keep  you informed.
Kay
