Ken:  It is my understanding that we must get approval from the Office of the  Chairman to utilize the company aircraft for personal use.
My family is holding a Holiday Reunion in Atlanta December 18-23.
Debbie and  I would like to fly to Atlanta and back on Friday, December 22, with our  children.
The twins, Jason and Jessica, are a little bit too young yet to  try the commercial airlines, which is why I am requesting to use a company  aircraft.
Of course, we would only secure a plane if it is NOT needed for business  purposes that particular day and would be subject to company policy on all  charges.
No problem if this doesn't work!
Stan
