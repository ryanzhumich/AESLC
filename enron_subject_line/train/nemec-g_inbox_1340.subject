As we discussed, I wanted to confirm LRCI, Inc.'s consent to our recordation of the map referenced in Exhibit A of the Act of Sale as a part of the Act of Sale pursuant to which Reliant Energy Gas Storage, LLC purchased real property from LRCI on November 26, 2001.
If this is acceptable, please so indicate by responding to this email.
Thanks!
