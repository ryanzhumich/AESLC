Vanessa, I checked with Bill, and the very unsatisfying answer to your  question is that it totally depends on how Greg divided the community  property with his ex.
He agreed with me that a will is a good idea in any  case because you can arrange things so that you avoid legal proceedings and  save a lot in taxes!
Our friend Tony Maluski does probate work:  I believe  his number is 713-228-7401.
He's a nice guy and I believe him to be  competent; however, I think it is a good idea to shop around when you're  doing something routine like a will or an uncontested divorce, so I'd advise  calling several lawyers and see who you like best and who will give you the  best deal.
If I can find some other names/numbers for you, I will.
Hope  this helps!
