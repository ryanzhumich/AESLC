Pat,  I am going to forward you a draft of an amendment to the employment agreement  for Greg Whalley.
I would appreciate your thoughts on the language,  particularly the language in amended section 2.1b regarding the calculation  of value for options/restricted stock.
For some reason, I cannot attach it to this email, so I will have my  assistant send it under separate email cover.
Thanks a lot.
