Mara:  Attached are blacklined versions based upon Cargill's comments to both the  Enron Corp. and Cargill, Incorporated which I received from Ed Sacks.
Please  note that I added a comma to guarantor's name in the Cargill, Incorporated  guaranty since that is how we executed the Cargill, Incorporated ISDA Master  Agreement.
Also, your change to the setoff language is fine.
Let's try to agree to everything this week.
Thanks.
