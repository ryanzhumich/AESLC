Attached are two versions of a press release.
We plan to issue one of these before market open tomorrow.
The second version assumes financial close on the remainder of the secured credit facility (I need someone to confirm or deny).
The first version speaks only to the merger and our debt restructuring efforts.
Please review and provide comments as soon as possible to me and Karen Denne (karen.denne@enron.com).
I understand that Jeff McMahon and Jimmy Lee will discuss the attached at 7:00 CST tomorrow.
