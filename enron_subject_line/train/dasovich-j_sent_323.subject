OK, the powers that be have phoned.
I am to be there tomorrow and Wed.
Tomorrow I'm huddle at the Woodlands all day.
But Wednesday I'll be in the  office.
Perhaps coffee or lunch?
Could you forward to the lovely Ms Scott,  since every time I type her name in, I get someone from ECT.
Can't wait to  hear more about Herr Cherr-y.
Best,

I'm Back!
