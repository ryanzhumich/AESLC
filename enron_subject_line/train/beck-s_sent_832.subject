I will be out of the office on vacation on Friday, March 2 and Monday, March  5.
I will check messages at the end of both business days.
My assistant,  Patti Thompson ( x35926) will have contact numbers for me.
Since I will be a  chaperone for my daughter and 80 other girls from the high school drill team  at state competition in Dallas, it is unlikely that I will be easily  reachable during the day.
I will be back in the office on Tuesday, March 6.
