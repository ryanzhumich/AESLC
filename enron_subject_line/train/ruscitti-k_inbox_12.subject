We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline website tonight .
The following are the changes  1.
Changes to Stack Manager:  1.1 Changes to toolbar icons: To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager.
The attached file shows the old icon and its new replacement.
Next to each image below is the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut key that is mapped to the same function:     1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change from a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a specific product.
This function is useful if your products use automatic price resets.
To activate this feature: 1.
Select a product and click on Product Properties 2.
Check the Enable box 3.
Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values 4.
Click Update Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00  You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered.
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute.
