Just a note to let you know that per my conversation with Tanya, after review  by Brent, today I will be sending out am amendment to BMO allowing for the  provision of Cash as Eligible Collateral under the ISDA.
When we get this in  signed I will send my usual email out to the world explaining this amendment,  but you may want to think about what procedures you will need to put in place  to make sure this happens EVERY time we take collateral in (not to mention,  we will also have to pay Canadian counsel to file releases as well , and this  will cost us money too!
We don't want to have to do this too often.)
Anything you want to tell me before I send this out today?
