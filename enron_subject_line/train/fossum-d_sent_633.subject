Congratulations on the move!
Its great to see a reorg that actually seems to  make so much sense!
Thanks again to you and Terry for watching the three  stooges on Saturday night.
It was great seeing you guys again and getting  the kids a chance to play for a while.
We'd love to return the favor next  time you come up to Omaha--the weather is getting real nice right about
