Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want to  do with the Bankers Trust trades.
In particular, they haven't thought  through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like on online  documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full novation of the  trades once they decide how to resolve this.
So, until we hear back from  them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers Trust financial trades  and master sit.
