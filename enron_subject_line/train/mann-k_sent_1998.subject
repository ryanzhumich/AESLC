Paige wrote me at 430 this am, and said that since she was still up at 430,  she probably won't be home in time for Michael's parties.
Should I just  leave him after gymnastics?
I don't really want to come back the office, but  I do want to go to Anne's.
Hmmm.
If Paige is home by 500, everything might  work.
