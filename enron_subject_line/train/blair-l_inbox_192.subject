Team, I would like for you to review the attached Shipper assignment list.
With Renee leaving and 	Pat still on a learning curve, I wanted to throw out some possibilities and get your input.
I did not 	spend a lot of time on interconnects, so you may want to look at those closely.
I did talk with John, 	Terry, Raetta and Larry for input.
Please review, discuss and set up some time to visit with me about 	your comments.
Thanks.
Lynn
