Mark,    Jeff is considering taking Jeffrey on an African safari July 4-13, and was  wondering if you would have any interest in joining them.
He is in the  process of gathering information now and has not yet committed, but wanted to  guage your interest.
He's looking primarily at the Ngorongoro conservation  area and the Serengeti.
I can forward a proposed itinerary to you once  received from the guides.
Please let us know if you're at all interested.
Thanks, Sherri
