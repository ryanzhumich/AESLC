Marie,    I just spoke to Robert Allen and they are going to send you a retun slip so that the 7 yards can be sent back via UPS without charge.
They have a 17 yard piece that they will ship to you.
I think the Houston show room screwed up the order - because I have a copy of what I sent them in writing - and it says 17 yards.
They have the 17 yards in stock so it shouldn't take long.
Just keep your eyes open for the return tag that they will send you in the mail for the 7 yards.
Ah -  the trials and tribulations of home decorating!
