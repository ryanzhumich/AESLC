The New York City Marathon will take place as scheduled on Sunday, November 4, 2001.
In the wake of the terrible events of September 11, the New York City Marathon will highlight the diversity, energy, and resilience of New York City as never before, said Allan Steinfeld, race director of the New York City Marathon and president and CEO of New York Road Runners.
No course changes are planned, as the five-borough New York City Marathon route does not go near the site of the World Trade Center disaster in lower Manhattan.
Steinfeld added, New York Road Runners is dedicating the 2001 New York City Marathon to the victims of the tragic events of September 11, and to the courageous rescuers who have worked tirelessly to save lives and to rebuild our great city and nation.
Please join New York Road Runners, our sponsors and partners, and runners from around the world in our effort to raise $1 million for the Twin Towers Fund, a united and coordinated effort to assist victims of the September 11 disaster and their families, and the families of the firefighters, police officers, emergency medical technicians, and Port Authority police involved in the rescue and recovery effort.
To support this initiative, make your donation to Twin Towers Fund and send it to:  New York Road Runners Attn: Twin Towers Fund 9 East 89th Street New York, NY 10128  For updated information on the NYC Marathon and other NYRR events, please stay tuned to our web sites, www.nyrrc.org and www.nycmarathon.org.
