Brant and Sara: Here is a very rough draft of a proposed letter agreement for NGTS.
It  requires some work but hopefully it's a start.
It cannot be finalized until  we see all of the physical and financial confirms and agreements and should  NOT be sent to NGTS until Sara and I are comfortable that it works.
