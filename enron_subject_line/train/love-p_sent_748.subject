Please inactivate the FT-INT-CNT-TRAN book in TAGG.
All of the sub books  associated with this should also be inactivated, i.e.
Price, Basis, Index and  GD.
The trader responsible for these books has been gone for over 6 months  and all the deals in that book have now rolled off.
If you need any further  information, please feel free to give me a shout.
Thanks for your help.
