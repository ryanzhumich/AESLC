At Lisa Mellencamp's request I am sending you the amendment agreements that  we have drafted with respect to the physical and financial masters between  KCS and Enron.
Drafts of these agreements were sent to Harry Stout earlier  this week and some changes have been made since then.
I am enclosing both  clean and marked copies.
If you have any questions, please call me or Lisa.
My number is 853-3989.
