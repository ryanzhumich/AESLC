Good morning, Jean -   I understand from Rob Bradley that you are putting together some facts for  Ken as he is moderator of this panel tomorrow in Austin.
He said that he  would like some bullet points about basic trend data last five years re:   natural gas production and oil production in the State.
He also would like  facts about electricity transmission and any copies of articles about the  subject.
Thanks.
