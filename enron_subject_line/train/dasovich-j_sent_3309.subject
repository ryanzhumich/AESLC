Joe/Sue:  We'll need to brief Steve on the fed/state issues tied to the state buying  the TX systems of PG&E and Edison prior to his meeting with the Congressional  Republicans tomorrow.
I'll be driving with Steve from  LA to Pasadena (where  the meeting is) tomorrow beginning at about 9:30 AM PST (the meeting's at  10:30 AM PST).
Could we put together a call-in number at 9:45 or 10 AM PST  so you could quickly/briefly brief Steve on the issues prior to the 10:30 AM  meeting?
Let me know if this works, or if there's a better way to get him up  to speed on the issues before the meeting.
Thanks very much for helping to  pull this together on such short notice.
Best,
