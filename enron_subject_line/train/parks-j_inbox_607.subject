Men:  The dreaded time has come.
Rent goes up and it is a month earlier.
The initial $8,000 payment is due to Mertz on March 1, 2002.
In addition, I paid Mertz $500 for the protien that he fed during the last  hunting season.
I need each of you to forward me a check for $1,071.42.
Send to 815 walker,  suite 1447, H/T 77002.
Thank you.
Erik.
