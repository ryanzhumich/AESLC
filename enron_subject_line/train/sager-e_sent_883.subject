ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE   EPMI filed an amended petition with the court in Tennessee where EPMI's  current declaratory judgment action (interface issue) is pending alleging  that TVA violated NERC rules as a result of TVA's actions during the summer  of 99.
In order to amend the current petition to include this additional  claim, EPMI needs the courts approval.
Please call me if you have any questions.
