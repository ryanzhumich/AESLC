Attached is a unilateral form of Confidentiality Agreement where Counterparty  is the protected party.
This form needs a little tweaking since it is more  directed for a financing transaction.
Peter can find it, as well as other  forms, in the attorney forms bank.
Call me, or have Peter call me, if I can  be of further help.
