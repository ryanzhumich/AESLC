The following customers are currently covered by Fred Lagrasta's middle market desk primarily for derivative transactions.
In all cases except for Hallwood, ENA Denver has a relationship with these customers that primarily covers their physical business, we would like to expand that business to cover their Derivative business as well.

Fred could continue to cover their East, Central and Oil/Liquids business.
