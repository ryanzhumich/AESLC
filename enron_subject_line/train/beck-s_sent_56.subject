The responsibility for granting access to the DPR and associated reports  available through the Executive Viewer on line is being shifted from Scott  Tholen's team to my operations team.
(This makes a lot of sense, since it  is our group that prepares all of these reports.)
Fernley Dyson has  requested access to this information via the Executive Viewer.
In insuring a  tight distribution list for these reports, please let me know via return  e:mail or voice mail (x35926) that you would like for Fernley to have access  to the Enron-wide DPR.
Thanks.
