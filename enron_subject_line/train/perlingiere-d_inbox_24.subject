Debra:  I have briefly discussed some of the issues concerning the changes we feel are appropriate with your diversity program: Ms. Hunter, Mr. Eakins, Ms. Medcalf.
They were interested about in my reasoning behind the suggested changes.
I realize their could or will be different verbiage concerning my change's; however, the intent is firm because of the standard GISB payment dates previously agreed upon as well as anticipated payment date for other Resale Customers.
I am assuming there is little room for negotiation as the agreement format requirement of the Buyer?
Please advise me of your comments concerning the changes so as we can move forward.
I have been asked to keep the Diversity people informed of my progress so I am copying Ms. Hunter on this E-Mail.
Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.
