Danny, I'm resending as I had the same problem Cindy did.
I'll give you a  call later today after I've talked to Harris to discuss the various Gallup  scenarios to make sure you and I are on the same page.
The plan that makes  the most sense in my mind is to ram the 10,000/d  project through asap, with  no firm contracts to preserve our options on a NEWCO structure.
We'll  simultaneously implement a new approach on San Juan fuel transport if  possible and then throw the big expansion into the hopper at FERC in January  as Stan suggested.
I hope that timetable is doable--it all depends on
