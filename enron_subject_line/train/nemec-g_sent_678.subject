Dan and Teresa,  Attached is the form of declaration of Managing Member under  which Crescendo appoints ENA to exclusively negotiate a gathering deal with  Wildhorse.
Please review.
Teresa,  Do you think we need to get the Class B member approval also for  this appointment of ENA as representative?
The LLC Agreement is open with  respect to the Managing Member delegating its duties.
Dan or Ward,  Please note that the Crescendo LLC Agreement Section 6.3  indicates that if the Managing Member request the Class C Member (Enron) to  provide certain financial or technical services, then Class C Member may do  so for market based rates.
Is it the intention that Enron be reimbursed for  any commercial or engineering services it provides to the LLC such as  negotiating with Wildhorse or Project Management of the Plant Construction?
