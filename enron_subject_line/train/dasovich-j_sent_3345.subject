Sue:  The way that I understood what Loretta said, the utilities will not be forced  to absorb the shortfall between the price cap and DWR's cost of power.
Instead, she said that DWR will be responsible for those costs.
(That ought  to make DWR an even less creditworthy entity.)
I'll check in with Mike Day's  folks to make sure that I heard correctly and get more details.
Will report  back just as soon as we get more information.
Best,
