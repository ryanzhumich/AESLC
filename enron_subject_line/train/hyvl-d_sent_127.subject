Mike,  Attached please find a draft confidentiality agreement which we would  propose to use with the financial information required to be provided  pursuant to the guaranty.
If acceptable, please print and start execution,  we will sign when we receive the other documents.
Sorry for the delay, I had  requested this from our credit department and forgot to follow thru.
