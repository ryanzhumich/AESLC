Guys, as a follow up to our meeting today, I thought I would put together a  list of deliverables agreed to in the meeting.
The goal would be to have a  definitive strategy for HPL and storage assets by the end of July that could  be acted upon.
a) Elimination of the Entex contract - current value - John L.;  b) Storage value algorithm incorporating spread values, increasing intra-day  and monthly volatility and blowdown values - Jean M, John L, Jim S.;  c) Storage acquisition targets and issues surrounding value/execution - top  5 to 10 for blowdown and tarantula strategy - Jean M, Julie G.;  d) Structure, value, cost and issues surrounding Bammel "header" - Jean M.;  e) Project Torque - definitive balance sheet, income statement and  contribution margin statement for HPL - Wes C.;  f) Establish viability of selling HPL assets - small private placement -  working with Lehman to finalize value, exection risk, timing, structure et al  - Patrick   W.    I would like this group to get back together in the fourth week of July to  determine a final action plan.
