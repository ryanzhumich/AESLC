Sorry we've been out of touch lately.
We were on vacation (sailing in the  Virgin Islands) the week of Thanksgiving and were pretty busy getting ready  for it the week or two before that.
There was a big swim meet in San Antonio  last weekend that T wanted to see so we drove out for that (yawn).
I didn't even know you were leaving BA!
I knew you had been sort of looking  around for a while but didn't realize you had made a decision.
What's the  story?
We're planning to have people over (it's the egg nog time of year) on the  18th - I'm guessing 8 - 10 pm but we'll let you know the details.
