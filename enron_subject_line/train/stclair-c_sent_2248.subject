Randy: As I mentioned in my voice mail to you, we have accepted the CSP language  with the October 2002 date and with my other modifications which Susan sent  to you yesterday.
With respect to the Guaranty, the last draft that I saw  had a termination date of June 30, 2001.
Just want to make sure taht  whatever is signed has a different termination date (i.e.
June 30, 2002).
Again, before we release our Guaranty I would like to see the final version  of your Guaranty.
Thanks.
