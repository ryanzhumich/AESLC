Jim,  I really appreciate the offer.
Sorry for the delay in responding - things  have been a little crazy.
I would like to accept the tickets for myself.
Dutch is on vacation and I have left him a voicemail asking if he's is  interested.
I will give you a call a little later in the day when things  settle down.
Thanks,
