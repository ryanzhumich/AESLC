Paul,   Attached is the most recent versions of the above-referenced agreements which  incorporates the changes you negotiated with our Credit Department.
There  was one additional change to the Master Agreement to Section 4.2(ix).
I have  also attached the letter agreement which cancels the physical gas deals for  April.
Please review and give me your comments.
