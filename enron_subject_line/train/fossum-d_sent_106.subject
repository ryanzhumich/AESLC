That was an interesting little conversation.
I came back down and looked for  you guys but you had both split.
We should take a few minutes and plug John  in on what happened at the end of that meeting when the power issues came  up.
I'm somewhat surprised at Bill's reaction, but what the hell, now we can  run with Cunningham, and we know MKM's pulse on Hubbard (and Bill's).
Pretty  damn good end to the week, all things considered.
