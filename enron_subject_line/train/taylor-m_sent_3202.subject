I spoke with Susan Bulgawicz again today.
She relates the following points:  Gensler has been subcontracted to do interior space planning and design for  the new building generally While our work is probably in addition to that already agreed (and will  therefore be billed to us) it should be covered by an amendment to the  existing agreement rather than a new, separate agreement Bill Donovan feels that the design and space planning work should be done as  near in time as possible to the actual construction work to avoid having to  redo the work (and pay twice) to take into account new factors not apparent  earlier (e.g.
organizational and technology changes) Bill's view is that we are 3 to 6 months premature at this point in doing  this work for the legal department  Susan suggested that you might want to call Bill to discuss this and talk  about how you want to move forward.
