I think you were going to identify the Lagrasta deals after our meeting of  last Tuesday (Oct. 19).
I've done a quick review (although I'm not as  familiar with the deals as you may be) and think there are 9 deals:   Aries Resources, LLC [Classic Resources Inc.] - dropped Formosa Hydrocarbons, Inc. - Breslau also concerned Hallwood Energy Corporation HS Resources Inc. Neumin Production Co. - Breslau also concerned Titan Resources L.P. TXU Energy Trading Company (?)
Vastar Resources, Inc.  Could you please verify.
