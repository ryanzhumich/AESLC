Hey Kevin,  How is it going cousin?
Found the napkin that you left your  email address on at Kenneally's.
Man, I really was loaded by the time I left  that place.
I went down to CC the next day and told my parents we had met.
They said they had just been at your wedding not to long before Christmas.
Small world!
How's Houston treating you?
Been back to Kenneally's since?
Drop me a line  when you get a chance.
Gerald,
