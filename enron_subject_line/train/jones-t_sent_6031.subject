I never heard back from you.
You were going to look at my list of approved  jurisdictions and see if you disagreed with any of my information.
I'll be  out the rest of the week, but maybe when I get back we can chat again on the  phone, and maybe pull Edmund in, because before Edmund got sick, we were  pretty much in agreement on how he was supposed to respond about Americas  countries and how I should respond about European countries.
