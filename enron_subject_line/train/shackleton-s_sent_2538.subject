Aaron:  I spoke with both Matt Flett (Morgan counsel) and Denis O'Connell about the  ISDA already negotiated by EnronCredit.com Limited.
Each was supposed to  send me the draft docs for me to review and comment on for ENA.
I have not  received anything yet but will comment immediately upon receipt.
I'll keep  you up to date.
