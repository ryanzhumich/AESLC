Mary,  Please prepare a draft bi-latieral CA with the following entity:  RealEnergy, Inc. 1900 Avenue of the Stars, Suite 755  Los Angeles, California 90067  The topic of the CA should be information concerning a potential sale of  natural gas and/or provision of transportation capacity for RealEnergy's  distributive generation requirements in southern California.
You can use the Huber CA we just did for the form.
Please check conflicts  with Kay Young as well.
Thanks.
