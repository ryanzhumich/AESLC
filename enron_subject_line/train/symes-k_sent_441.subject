Here's what I threw together this afternoon.
Let me know if there are any  other people in particular you'd like added to the list.
Also let me know if  you try any of these extensions and they happen to be wrong (we have a hard  time keeping up with changing numbers too!).
Forward this on to anyone you  feel it might be useful to; but please let them know to call me first and  foremost, since I'll probably be the most receptive on the phone.
Hope you had a safe trip back home.
Again, it was great to meet you and Kim.
Talk to you soon, Kate
