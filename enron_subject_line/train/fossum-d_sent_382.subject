Here's a thought that didn't occur to me when I marked up the mock trial  script.
Should we have the consultants prominantly feature "IPEC  Busters"???
Unless we are pretty sure the judge will keep it out on  relevance grounds, it might be useful to at least get some juror reactions to  it.
With or without the specific IPEC Busters stuff, we probably ought to  assume that Jad's theme will be that Northern's whole philosophy was to  breach contracts without flinching if it served our commercial interests.
The vitriol from P&P and the other producers plays into that theme.
Maybe we  ought to spice that part of the script up a bit also just so we can see how  our response plays.
