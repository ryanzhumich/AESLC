Tana: Could you please talk to Anthony about the need for video conferencing as he  mentioned something to Suzanne about needing that and let Suzanne know if we  will be hooking anyone else in and if so, who and how?
Alos, does a total of  20 people (which includes our group) sound right to you?
Finally, what time  do you want to start?
We have the room from 11:30 to 2?
Please let Suzanne  know the above details.
Thanks.
Carol
