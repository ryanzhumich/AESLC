Hi Corey -  My champion, hero, angel - I think I have made a major mistake!!!
I thought  I had tickets to Mark McGuire's team for May 12, but it is the Cinncinatti  Reds!!!
I am so sorry.
Is that going to be o.k.?
That's  what I get for  thinking I know anything about baseball.
Look forward to hearing from you!!
Love,

This is for my Champion
