Judy,  I thought I was through, but I'm not.....Can you please send up the the  following contracts:  Wisconsin Power & Light  96045691  WPS     96001003  Also, if someone in my group has already checked it out and returned to you,  just tell me who had it and I'll copy off of them (smile!!).
Also, do you have a copy of the GTC.
We have no idea what it is, and we're  looking for the non-performance language associated with it.
Thanks!
