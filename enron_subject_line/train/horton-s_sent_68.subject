FYI....we have added Dan Dienstbier to the Northern Border Partners' Audit  Committee.
SEC rules dictated that we add another member, and Dan Whitty and Gerald  Smith wanted someone with an operations background.
Dan also serves on Dynegy's Board, but neither Bill Cordes (President of  Northern Border) nor I saw a conflict.
