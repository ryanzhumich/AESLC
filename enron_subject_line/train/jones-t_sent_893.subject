The NYMEX has approved all of your applications and you should all have  access to the system and be able to trade (everyone except Dana Davis, who  still needs to complete his training).
Please let me know if you cannot log  in.
I spoke to the NYMEX a minute ago and there is no reason from their  perspective why you should not be able to log in.
