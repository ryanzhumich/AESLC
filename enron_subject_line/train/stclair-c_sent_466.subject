Mark: I just wanted to update you on where things stand currently with respect to  the Domain Name Transfer Agreement that we are negotiating with Risk  Management Solutions, Inc.  After visiting with Scott about the reps and  warranties, he became concerned about the overall scope of the agreement and  in particular, what in addition to the URL domain name (weather-desk.com) EEL  was being asked to transfer and the restrictions that RMS wanted to place on  EEL with respect to this Domain Name and "any variations thereof."
We went  back to RMS and told them basically that all we were willing to do was  transfer them the URL domain name with no strings attached.
I'm not sure  that this will be acceptable to them given their future intentions which is  to acquire from another third party the name "weatherdesk.com" , register it  and use it with respect to the products that they offer.
All of these discussions that we have had over the past week with respect to  our domain name have lead Seth, Scott and I to question what Enron's intent  is with respect to the name or any variations thereof given the fact that  according to Scott we have submitted applications to register similar names.
We were hoping that you could help us answer this question or at least lead  us to the right people that could.
It seems odd that we would be wiling to  transfer this name and yet feel that it is important to pursue registering  these other names.
I look forward to hearing from you.
