I will be on vacation the week of March while my children are on Spring  Break.
We will be out of town Monday through Wednesday, looking at colleges  with Meagan.
We should return to Houston on Wednesday night.
I have planned  to be out of the office for the balance of the week, but may decide to return  to work on Thursday and Friday.
My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), will  have contact numbers for me while I am out of town in case something urgent  arises.
I will also let her know during the week whether or not I will be  back at work on Thursday and Friday.
