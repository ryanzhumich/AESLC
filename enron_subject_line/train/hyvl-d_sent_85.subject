Ellen,  I am attaching a redline and a clean copy of the Enovate/Reliant contract, 2  proposed transactions to be entered under such contract, and a redline and a  clean copy of the ENA/Reliant contract.
If these meet with your approval,  let me know and I will prepare execution copies for each party to sign.
Please note that the credit group made one change to the language in section  4.2.
