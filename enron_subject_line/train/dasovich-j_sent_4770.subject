I've received a copy of the powerpoint presentation Hertzberg made to the his  caucus.
Unfortunately, it's a fax and hardly legible.
I can make out,  however, that it is the core/noncore plan.
I'm attempting to get a better  copy and will distribute as soon as I get my hands on it.
Please keep  confidential that we have a copy.
Thanks.
Best,
