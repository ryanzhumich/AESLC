Sharen told me this morning that you guys were waiting on a deal Stewart  Rosman did with Port of Oakland yesterday and wanted confirmed today.
I've  spoken with a few people here and discerned that the deal wasn't in because  the counterparty wasn't in the system yet.
I took a look and found that Port  of Oakland had been added, and entered the deal according to the terms  Stewart sent out in an e-mail yesterday.
Deal number is 533916.
Thanks for  waiting.
