Emmisions Trading will go from Kevin Presto  (Greg Wolfe) to George McClellan  under the following  conditions.
1 -  Volumes will not fall.
In fact they will increase.
2 - Wolfe will retain 1 Million of the 3 Million VAR for six months and then  East Power will have no Emmisions Positions,  3 -  Janel Guerrero (middle marketer) will follow the book to coal.
4 - East Power and Coal will get together and (hopefully) agree on a transfer  pricing mechanism for existing positions if there are any that Greg is not  keeping.
Give me a call if there are any issues.
