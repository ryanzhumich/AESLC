I sold CES 2727dt of CGLF mainline gas (deal 221731) effective 21st-31st.
Aristech only had enough mainline capacity to pull away 751 dt.
I changed  the volume on this deal and created another sale to CES at the CGAS pool  (deal 222359) for a volume of 1917 dt.
2727 - 751 = 1976 at mainline.
1976 at mainline less fuel of 2.988% = 1917 at the CGAS pool.
Price = $2.77  .1045  variable cost mainline to Leach  .0250  demand charge
