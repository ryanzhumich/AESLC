Attached is a file we put together with the daily figures on them for Central  1 & Central 2.
The total page should tie to what I gave you last week.
I  highlighted the five days on each month the highest absolute value change.
I  then attached those days P&L top sheets.
Please review this information and  let us know what type of detailed support you will need.
Thanks.
