John,  This is a follow-up to our earlier discussion.
I would like to have you lay  out our physical crude needs to become a player a long with some action steps  to accomplish the goal.
I don't want to forget about this because I believe  it may be something we need to assign someone or a mid-market or originator  or team to accomplish.
I would like to see foreign and domestic.
I see this as one of our possible competitive advantages or at least to solve  the problem of not being in the know and getting second hand info or  pricing.
Thanks,
