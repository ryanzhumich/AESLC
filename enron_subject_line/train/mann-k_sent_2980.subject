Dale,  Has GE initialled all the pages of the break out contract?
If so, it would  be very helpful if you could ship me the originals.
That way, we only have  to change the names, which will make it easier for Lee when we have to ask  him to sign.
Also, has someone from the Enron side initialled all the  pages?
That helps, too!
