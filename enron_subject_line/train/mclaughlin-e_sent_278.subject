Frank,  I'm sorry,  but disregard the first message I sent.
The $234MM value I  alluded to is not the value for the one deal booked with a 1993 deal date.
This value represents the MTM value for all active deals w/ Sithe.
I'm still  working to find a deal like your requested.
I'll let you know.
Thanks,
