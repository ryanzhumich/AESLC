I would appreciate if each of you could provide a brief (one-page or less)  bullet point summary of the week's activity by close of business each  Friday.
You can send either via e-mail or fax.
Jeff has his staff meetings on Monday mornings and it would help me keep him  abreast of key activities in your respective areas.
I don't need anything elaborate.
Thanks,
