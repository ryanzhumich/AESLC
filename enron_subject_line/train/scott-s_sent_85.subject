Here is some preliminary research on the Commercial Group's question of  whether we can have a tariff provision in which shippers pay cash for fuel  rather than providing fuel in kind.
If you want the attachments (examples of  other pipelines' tariff provisions) I will send you a hard copy.
Comments?
Are there any rate case implications I should be aware of?
