Deskheads:  I would like to have a 2 hour team building session for the assistants, receptionists, and clerks on Friday 5/25/01.
The only thing that will be charged to your cost center is the cost of a lunch brought in for the administrative staff.
I know that the assistants usually are out of here between 12:30 to 1:30 being that this is a Friday before a holiday.
I would like to have the session start at 12:30 so that they can still be out of here by 2:30 that day.
This would require the phones being on solo pilot starting at 12:30.
Please respond with your approval, questions and/or comments as soon as time permits so I can set everything up this week.
Many thanks, Ina Rangel
