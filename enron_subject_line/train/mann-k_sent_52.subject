Gentlemen:  I have been advised by J. Nassos that Peoples (through WestLB) will be  exercising the ABB option today.
I have asked that they send me a copy of the  notice of exercise of option, and I left Mike Sandridge a voice mail telling  him to expect it this afternoon.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Kay
