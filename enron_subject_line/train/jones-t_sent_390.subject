We are getting calls from our brokers and the NYMEX telling us the brokers  still have not received notification of our name change.
This is causing  problems with the brokers clearing the trades on the NYMEX.
Per my voicemail  several weeks ago, since you/your desk are our communications guy with the  brokers,  they need to receive the notice as soon as possible.
When will  you be able to get this notice our of our name change?
