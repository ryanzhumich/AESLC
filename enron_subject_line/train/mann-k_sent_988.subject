Gregg,  It is my understanding that Enron and Peoples intend to discuss the most  appropriate form of ISDA documentation for enovate to use.
Peoples has  forwarded a form for our information, and we would like to reciprocate.
Therefore, attached per your request are sample ISDA documents as a starting  point for discussions.
Since these are forms, there will certainly be  aspects which will need revision based on discussions between Peoples and  Enron.
These documents should be treated as confidential.
Kay
