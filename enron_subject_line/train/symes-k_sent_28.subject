I would be very interested in finding out more about the Deal Control  position and what it entails.
Coming from a background in print journalism  leaves me somewhat at a loss for practical experience; however, I make up for  skills in my ability to learn quickly and work aggresively.
I'll come by  sometime today to talk further about this opportunity.
Thanks for the notice.
Kate
