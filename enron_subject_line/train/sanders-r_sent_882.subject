As outlined in Mark Haedicke's voicemail to you, I have attached a draft  response to Long Island Power's letter.
We are attempting to obtain a  release from LIPA of any claim related to the terminated transaction.
As a  result, I would recommend that we hold off sending this letter until the  release has been negotiated, which should be by Thursday, March 15th.
Please  call me if you have any questions.
