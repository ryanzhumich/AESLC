Attached is the list reflecting the approval of the initial Australian  counterparties to trade Australian financial power only.
David Minns will  have to get back to us about all the other products!
For the current U.S. list of counterparties, just mirror the approvals for  "US Power Financial Swaps".
I will review the list Debbie is sending me tomorrow to see if any of her  approvals conflicts with my earlier approvals, but I think we should be fine.
