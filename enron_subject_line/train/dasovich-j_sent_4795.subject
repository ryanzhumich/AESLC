I've had several phone calls with large customer groups over the past  24-hours, mostly explaining our noncore/core proposal (in contrast to the one  that the Assembly Democrats have launched which would saddle business with  100% of the utilities' past debts).
As folks know, the cost shift provision  of the Dems plans have been erroneously attributed to us in some cases.
The business folks have been very appreciative of the discussions and have  recognized that, generally, our proposal is a fair and reasonable one.
They  are going to try to set up direct negotiations with Hertzberg and have  requested that I be part of those negotiations.
They are not sure that  Hertzberg will go along with the idea, but they're going to try.
They will  get back to me when they find out.
I'll report back soon as I hear  something.
