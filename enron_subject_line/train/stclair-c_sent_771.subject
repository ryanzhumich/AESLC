Jeff: As I think you are aware, the Meixco and online group want to implement  online trading for Mexican counterparties.
Are there any tax issues taht we  should be aware of?
If we conduct online trades using ENA and telephone  trades with an Enron Mexican entity, will the exercise of setoff rights  create any tax issues?
My understanding is that the Enron counterparty will  be ENA.
