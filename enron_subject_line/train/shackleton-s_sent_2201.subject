FYI - I spoke with Thomas Fay in NY about setting up Instinet in London.
I  HAVE BOTH INSTINET FILES IN MY OFFICE.
Sam, I told Thomas that we do not  need copies of any agreements.
You must have been looking for them while I  was on vacation.
Remember, broker'futures agreements are in RED files to  make them visible.
