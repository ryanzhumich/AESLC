ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE   Pursuant to a letter faxed to TVA today, January 27th, we notified TVA that  EPMI was terminating the MOPA effective February 11, 2000 (earliest date  permitted under the MOPA).
At the same time, we filed an amended petition  with the court in Tennessee where EPMI's current claim against TVA (interface  issue) is pending seeking a declaratory judgment that EPMI had the right to  terminate the MOPA.
In order to include this additional claim in the already  filed petition, we will need the approval of the court.
Copies of the letter will be distributed later .
