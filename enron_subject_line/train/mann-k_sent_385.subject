I am attaching a operating lease summary which I have revised to include some  basic asset operation stuff.
I've left Lisa a voice mail with a brief  explanation of what we are doing, and asking her if she would take a look at  this from a financing "fatal flaw" standpoint, with Enron being the lessor.
I've been summoned to Nowhere North Carolina (Rocky Mount) for the remainder  of the day and tomorrow, and will be back on Friday am.
Anne, I hope this helps keep you moving.
Lisa, many, many thanks.
