Attached please find a proposed form of Termination Agreement for Canadian  Imperial Bank of Commerce.
Obviously, we need to still input the trades.
Peter,  It appears that our signers on the trading floor will be offsite in PRC  meetings on Thursday.
I need to know ASAP when we plan on signing this  because I am going to have to call around to find an officer that might be  in.
