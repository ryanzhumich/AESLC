Sorry I can't wish you well in person but I have a severe case of  laryngitis!.
Fortunately, I'm on antibiotics but the doctor said "Don't speak  for 3 days.
I wish my wife would get laryngitis."
Maybe the desert air in  Arizona would bring relief.
I love saguros (is that right?)
Daddy thought  planning for Chanukah was a great idea.
Also, tell Daddy that if he used  e-mail I could talk to him even when I have laryngitis.
Love, Sas
