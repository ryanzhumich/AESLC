Linda & Sharon,  My primary job responsibility is to online trading, and right now EnronOnline  is quite a beast of a customer.
Because of that I please ask that you direct  any future questions you may have with respect to confirmations to our two  paralegals who handle the day to day trading, Susan Bailey at x34737 and  Stephanie Panus at x53249.
With respect to the two current Canadian confirmations, Sara Shackleton, an  attorney in our Group, is working with Credit to resolve the questions on the  Slater Steel and Casco credit worksheets.
