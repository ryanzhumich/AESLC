Dear Ms. Beck and Ms. Apollo,  It was a sincere pleasure to meet with you yesterday.
The information I  learned during the interview served to confirm the feelings I have always had  about Enron.
Unfortunately I received the disappointing news that Enron was not  pursuing employment possibilities with me further.
I feel strongly that Enron and its  products and services have an exciting growth ahead, and  I  definitely would like to be considered for opportunities available in the  future.
Again, I appreciate your time and  consideration, and hope to hear from you in the near  future.
Sincerely,

@subject
