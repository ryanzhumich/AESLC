Chris Foster has requested that we set up a new broker - the Automated Power  Exchange, in EnPower.
It is the same counterparty we already have in EnPower,  with the same name and contact information.
Melissa, I believe you said we  could pretty easily add the name in the broker list if it was the same as in  the counterparty list, which Chris has verified it is.
Please let me know if  you need anymore information.
Thanks,
