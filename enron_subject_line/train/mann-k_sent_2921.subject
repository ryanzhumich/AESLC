Stuart,  If you need a copy of the executed Westinghouse letter, you can find the  original on my desk, I believe on the left hand corner (looking out).
The  letter we are waiting for is merely an acknowledgement that LJM doesn't need  to sign.
I think getting the letter is probably belts and suspenders, but I  requested it anyway.
