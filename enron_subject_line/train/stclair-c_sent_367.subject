Susan: I would like to talk to you briefly next week sometime about what in your  opinion would be the best way to train the new legal assistant that we plan  to hire.
In particular, could you give some thought as to what worked the  best for you and what didn't work.
I will keep whatever you say  confidential.
I also have discussed with Mark that I want you to play a  significant role in the training process given the outstanding progress that  you have made in the last year.
Could you also give that some thought and  let me know what you think?
Thanks.
Carol
