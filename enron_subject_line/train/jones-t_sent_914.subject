Entergy Power Marketing Corp. has applied for a Password and has asked us to  give them a "comfort letter" stating that the current trading with them will  go under the respective master for the product and not the online GTC.
I  have spoken to Credit and we are trading financial gas, physical gas, and  physical power (through EPMI).
Can you please let me know first, if you have  a master agreement agreement in place with this counterparty would it govern  the product or would we need to use an override letter and if the master  agreement will govern the trades, please provide me the exact name, parties  and date of the contract.
Obviously, as usual with online matters, this is a  RUSH.
