The Guarantor is Centrica plc; the entities that the Guarantor is  guaranteeing are Accord Energy Limited and Direct Energy Marketing Limited.

Do we know what type of business ENA intends to do with these entities for  which this Guaranty has been drafted.
If so, let me know so that I can  forward to that group for them to approve and obtain ENA's signature.
