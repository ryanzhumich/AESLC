I just thought of one other thing we need to discuss with Credit in our  meeting.
I've asked them to get back to me about this several times and  haven't heard.
In the collateral annexes, we have interest on collateral computed at 360  days.
So we don't have problems with Canadian counterparties, I would like  to change that to 365/366 accross the board.
I asked them if there was any  specific reason why we've got interest on collateral at 360, like maybe it's  the custom in the bank/dealer markets.
Anyway, I'd like to get that  answered.
