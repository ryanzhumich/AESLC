The 9th Circuit of the U.S. Ct. of Appeals granted EES' request to stay an  injunction granted by the District Court in the UCS litigation, which would  have required EES to continue to directly serve UCS.
The stay allows EES to  return the customer UCS to PG&E and SCE for utility service and thereby save  the future accrual of an additional $144 million of negative CTC  receivables.
In approximately two months, the 9th Circuit will conduct a  further review of the stay, at which point the litigation will return to the  District Court for discovery and eventually trial.
