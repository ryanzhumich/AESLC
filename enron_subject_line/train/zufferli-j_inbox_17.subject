I attach an updated list (to Feb 5) of the terminated contracts to date.
F= or informational purposes, I have added a column that sets out the settleme= nt dates for contracts we have settled, so there may be some additional cou= nterparties added to my previous list where there was no ECC agreed termina= tion date but we have settled and terminated (no one needs to do anything f= or these c/ps).
Again, the first table sets forth the physical contracts t= hat have been terminated and the second sets out the financial contracts, a= nd all data reflects ECC's (not the counterparties') perception of the worl= d.  I have vetted my list against Blakes' master list and believe this is a= ccurate in all respects.
As I indicated in my previous e-mails to you ther= e were a few date discrepancies and I have previously provided you with the=  corrected dates for El Paso, Marathon, AEC Marketing, Calpine (Encal), Wil= liams Energy and Baytex (all physical), all which are now correctly reflect= ed in the attachment.
A few others that were not previously on the list in= clude Coast Energy (physical) which auto terminated on Dec 2 and PrimeWest = Energy (physical) which auto terminated on Dec 2.
