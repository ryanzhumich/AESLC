I forgot to mention something yesterday.
3 (g) states that within 10 days of  closing we will provide Coral with the documents on Exhibit T.  I personally  do not know if we have all the documents listed.
We need to either verify  that we have these documents, or add some language about providing the ones  in our possession.
Thanks,
