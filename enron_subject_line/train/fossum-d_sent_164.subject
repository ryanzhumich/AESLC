Bob, Steve Gilbert was not working on this, but he thought that the numbers  in 10ks and annual reports generally get filled in by Elaine Concklin or  someone based on ET&S numbers fed up throught the system by Gilbert's group.
For now, I'm leaving the blanks in this draft blank and explaining to Moran  that I have limited our review to the legal and regulatory verbiage.
Thanks.
