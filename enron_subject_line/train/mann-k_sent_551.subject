Hi Jo,  I left you a voice mail, but being an email addict I thought I would send you  a note as well.
Our son, Michael is in a Montessori kindergarten, which we have decided may  not be most suitable for him.
We discussed it with Vivian Shudde, and she  suggested that I give you a call about the Grace School.
My husband and I would like to visit Grace.
We are wondering if it might be  possible to visit tomorrow.
Please let me know what you think.
Thanks,
