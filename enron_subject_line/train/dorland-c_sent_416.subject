Hi Andrew!
How are things in London?
I am talking to MH right now and he says you are  getting a little tired of school.
I don't blame you one bit.
I need a vacation.
I bet you do to.
What do you say to a little Amsterdam  trip in April?
I think we deserve it.
What do you think of MH changing companies?
I think he should get out of that  business altogether.
He will hate NB just as much as ML inside 6 months.
Take care,  Chris
