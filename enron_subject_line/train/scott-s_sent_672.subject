...okay, maybe it's not THAT good but it's cooked and the beer is plentiful.
Hey everyone,  Just wanted to test the waters and see what kind of interest there was in  doing Steak Night tomorrow night at Little Woodrows.
I feel like it's been a  while since we really rallied the troops and I know I have personally missed  the interaction.
It's also been a while since we've attempted to solve the  worlds problems over cold Shiner and I think the world may be the worse for  it.
So, get back to me and let me know if anyone's up for an evening of  eating, drinking and most definitely being merry.
If it looks like 'a go',  I'll shoot everyone a follow-up email complete with ETA.
