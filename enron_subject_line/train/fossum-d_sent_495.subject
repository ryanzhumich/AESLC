I noted in the Finance and Accounting report that you guys are setting up a  meeting with AA to talk about the draft risk management document that folks  had been working on a year ago.
Please include Tony and I.
We had some  questions and concerns that I have long since forgotten but will renew and  talk to you about before the AA meeting.
Thanks.
