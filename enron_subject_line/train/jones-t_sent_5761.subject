I know I'm a pest...but we've got another gov't agency that doesn't have its  legal entity as part of the name.
This one is on the list of 2/21/01, and it  is the Western Area Power Administration, a division of the Department of  Energy, acting through it "CRSP" area (I'm not sure what that stands for,  it's the Central something something area) (ID#71175).
This particular counterparty has come up before on EOL, acting through  another area, the Upper Great Plains Area (ID#81177).
The way I had this  counterparty approved for EOL (I thought!)
was:  Western Area Power  Administration-Upper Great Plains, a Division of the United States Department  of Energy.
I don't know if we can go back and get this one fixed too, but it would sure  make Legal happy if we did...
