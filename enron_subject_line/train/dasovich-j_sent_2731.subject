We will set up a call-in number to relay to folks any actions the Commission  takes tomorrow.
The Commission meeting starts at 10 AM PST, but it's unclear  when they will take up our issue.
Since the press will likely have the place  surrounded, they may decide to do that item first.
We'll send out a notice  with a call-in # and time as soon as we have the information.
Best,
