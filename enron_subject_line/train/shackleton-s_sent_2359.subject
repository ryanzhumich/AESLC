I was looking forward to seeing you tomorrow and hope that we can arrange  something soon.
I'm not sure about my plans during the Thanksgiving holiday  but I think I'll be spending most of it in Houston.
I am taking a long  weekend (this weekend) in Napa with my sister, brother-in-law and Mike to  celebrate my birthday so I'm anticipating somewhat of an eating  exttavaganza.
Talk to you soon.
