It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's office  used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new  office that weekend.
I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out  your office will be included in the construction area.
Phase III will  probably start on the 25th.
That could always slip but I wanted to give you  as much notice as possible.
Hope you are all doing well.
Getting any sleep yet?
