Greetings Piper:  My name is Jeff Dasovich.
I'm in Enron's San Francisco office.
I think  you've spoken with Karen Denne.
Scott asked for some background materials on  our proposed solution to California's electricity crisis.
I'll be forwarding  those to you sometime between 5 and 6 PM PDT.
Does that work for you?
Best,
