Got a call from Dennis out of the blue this afternoon.
He's pretty gung ho,  and also alluded to several other projects he's got on the front burner  (gas-fired power deals).
He had met again with some DOE folks in DC about  the power contract and feels it is 70-80% locked in.
Have you ever known a  project developer who would admit to less than 70-80% odds???
I look forward  to talking on Tuesday.
DF
