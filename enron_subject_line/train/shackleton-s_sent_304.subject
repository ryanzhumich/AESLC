Although I am still waiting for another Brazilian visa, I would like to pose  several potential dates to meet with you regarding Enron North America Corp.  trading issues.
I am presently considering several time periods:    September 9,10, 12-17,19-24  Obviously, I can be available at any time during the month of Septermber as  well as future months.
But I would like to get started as soon as possible.
If you could kindly e-mail or call me (713/853-5620), I can elaborate  further.
Thank you.
Sara
