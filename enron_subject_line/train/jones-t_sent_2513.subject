On a going forward basis, can we add the type of corporation or entity the  counterparty is into the "Corporate History" drop down in Lotus Notes (like  Delaware corporation, North Dakota non-profit electric cooperative  corporation, Texas state agency, or whatever).
It helps me and some of the  non-US lawyers with their approvals for EOL..
Thanks!
