Enclosed is an ISDA worksheet for Panaco Inc.
They are very interested, as are many right now, in getting an ISDA in place that has netting language between financial transactions and physical gas.
Physical gas is done both at ENA and ENA Upstream Company LLC.
Can we put together such a document?
If there are any questions, please give me a call.
Thanks,
