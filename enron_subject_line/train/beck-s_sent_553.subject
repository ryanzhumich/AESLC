Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week.
Wanted to see if  you, Frank and Mo might be available for dinner one evening.
We arrive on  Monday morning (March 20th) and will return to Houston on Friday morning.
Our Tuesday night is booked, having dinner with Fernley.
But Monday,  Wednesday and Thursday are available.
Does it work for you with the baby to  do evenings?
Let me know.
