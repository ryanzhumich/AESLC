Rick,  I read your memo regarding Global Risk Management Initiative.
I am sending  you the information regarding a related initiative on which I have been working last  year and which is moving now into the implementation stage.
It's Enterprise - Wide Risk  Management and it's really an effort to measure business risks consistently across the  company.
I hope my group can be helpful in designing the general approach to this  problem.
Please, let me know what your thoughts are.
Vince
