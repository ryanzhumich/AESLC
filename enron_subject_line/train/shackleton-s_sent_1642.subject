Mary:  Attached is a format that I used in 1999 to inquire about certain  issues impacting financial trading with foreign counterparties.
I also have  information about possible New Guinea counsel which I will clear with Derrick  and Haedicke.
Our potential trading counterparty is a mining company called  "OK Tedi".
