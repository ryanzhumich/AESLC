ED:  (1)  The Alcoa lawyer wants to adopt the terms of the ENA/Alcoa Inc. master  for purposes of the December deal.
(2)  EWEB has requested the following provision:  DEFAULT RATE shall mean the lesser of (a) the per annum rate of interest  equal to the prime lending rate as may from time to time be published in "the  Wall Street Journal" under "Money Rates" on such day (or if not published on  such day the most recent preceding day on which published), plus two percent  (2%) but not to exceed in total fourteen percent (14%) annually, and (b) the  maximum rate permitted by applicable law.
