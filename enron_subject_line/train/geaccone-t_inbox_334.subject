Tracy, Attached is the 4th quarter forecast for EGAS.
It is essentially 4Q from 3CE.
This does not include gain/loss on assets sale which right now it would be Greenfield Shipping loss and EcoElectrica gain.
I'll find out the latest for those numbers  .
Please forward this to Steven Schwarzbach if everything looks OK.
Thank you.
