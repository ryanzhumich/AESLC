Sandi,   Do you have a complete contract for the Apache purchase under the Tenaska IV  deal?
Apache is billing us a rate that is $.11 below the commodity rate  stated on page 22 in the original contract.
In the documents I have, I can't  find a reason for the adjustment.
I may be missing an amendment or  something.
I thought that you may have a complete set of documents and could  help me out.
