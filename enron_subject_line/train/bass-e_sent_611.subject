Last year we played with a mandatory Tight End.
Do you want to continue this  and thus start 1 QB, 2 RBs, 3WRs, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 Def?
Also,  I need to know if you would prefer to determine the draft order prior  to the draft.
I would prefer to do this b/c it gives the opportunity to plan  and trade your picks.
Let me know.
