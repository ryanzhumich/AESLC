Ted Murphy and I met with the Arther Andersen team this morning that  accompanied us on our trip to Buenos Aires.
We reviewed the observations and  recommendations in written form that we had discussed briefly with you on our  last day your office.
After making a few changes, AA should be forwarding to  you a copy of the draft document later this afternoon.
We would welcome  your comments and your additions on anything that you think we may have  missed.
Ted and I will be meeting with Rick Causey and Rick Buy within the  next couple of days to discuss our operations and control review, so your  responses would be welcomed prior to that meeting.
I look forward to working with you and others in your office in my role over  Global Risk Management Operations.
In addition to overseeing common  standards and controls for opeartional practices, I will work as your  advocate for system and resource needs in order to insure success for your  business plan in Buenos Aires.
