Here's a draft of a termination letter.
I'd be happy to see what everyone  thinks before we use it.
For instance, what tone are we aiming for?
If we  want to be all legal and hard-nosed, I can throw in ETA section references,  etc.
or if we want to be softer we can emphasize other trading opportunities  within Enron and possibly explain our reasons for the termination.
Let me know what you think.
