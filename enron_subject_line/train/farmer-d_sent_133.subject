Kris,   Please forward this to the appropriate person.
We are buying gas from Duke at the Trevino Plant on Gulf Energy (Tejas)  Pipeline.
This is a purchase that we obtained with the CES deal.
Duke  (Laura Bates) has called, saying that they have not received payment in 4 or  5 months.
The deal in Sitara is #145125.
Please look into this and let me  know where we stand.
Thanks.
