Hi Dave,  I received a signed change order from Randy Milcer (not sure about that)  yesterday.
The form he signed indicates that ABB will be paying Enron, and  has one small mistake in the amount of payments made on the cancelled  transformers ($400 off).
With your permission I will substitute the correct  version so ABB gets the money.
Thanks,
