I have NO idea how I sent the email to jackie at kim's email address.
apologies.
i'm losing it.
did you guys meet last nite to discuss the project?
If not, do you want to  meet this weekend for a wee bit to discuss?
i'm in town.
just let me know.
i can't find ted's email on any notes and i'm too lazy (flaky) to search it  out.
best,
