I have heard through the grapevine that you produce a weekly status report on  the MG aquisition and assimilation.
Would you please include me on that  distribution list effective this week?
I believe that it is assumed that  Fernley Dyson will have day-to-day responsibility for this business once the  aquisition is completed.
However, in my role over Global Risk Management  Operations, I find myself fielding questions regarding our assessment of  operations and any issues surrounding assimilation.
Brent Price, who reports  to me and is on temporary assignment in the London office, has been keeping  me updated on progress to date.
His return soon to Houston, however, will  create a potential information gap that the weekly status report may help to  fill.
Thanks in advance to your attention to this.
