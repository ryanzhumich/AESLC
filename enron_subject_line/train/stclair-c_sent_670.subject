Ladies: I just wanted to thank you again for your thoughtfulness, support  and hard  work in making today such a special event for me and Charles Eugene!
As I  said at the shower, I'm lucky to have people like you as friends and  co-workers and each of you throughout the last year has helped me get through  this pregnancy and the events leading up to it, for which I am extremely  grateful.
I am truly overwhelmed by everyone's generosity and look forward  to finally putting all of my gifts to good use in the upcoming weeks.
Carol
