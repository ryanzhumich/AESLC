FYI.
Ken Lay asked to have the pitch that he's been making California be  quickly put into a few power point slides for use in meetings he's having  this week at the gathering of the Business Council (back East) with a group  of California CEOs (e.g., Sun, Chevron, Amgen, Bechtel and others).
This is  the version that we gave to Lay's office; he may have modified it.
Will  check with Rosalee to get the final and distribute that version if changes  were made.
Best,
