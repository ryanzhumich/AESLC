Lisa,   As i was pondering the meeting last night going home in my car, I realized  that I forgot to talk about 2 people,  including regulatory and your personal  efforts.
I apologize for that, it was unintentional and I hope you realize  how important you and your efforts are to EGM and Enron.
I could not read my  notes very well due to the extremely heavy lighting - that didn't appear on  my notes just on me.
Thanks,
