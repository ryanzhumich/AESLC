Team Salmon,  Carlos will be working the Enron consent/opinion docs.
I suspect he is  looking for a seat at the closing dinner, but the help is appreciated  regardless of motive.
Carolyn, the form of the escrow instruction letter looked fine.
I spoke with GE about the turbine contract, and I am optimistic that we will  have the "final form" today.
Ciao,  Kay
