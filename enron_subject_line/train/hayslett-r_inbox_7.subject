Hi Rod,  I know you will be looking into cost and support issues relating to the services we get from Enron Global Finance.
I am of the opinion that the dedication of a talented Global Finance professional will provide us with a much better work product (service) at a significantly lower cost, if we can get EGF to allocate 100% of the cost of the employee and eliminate their allocation to us entirely.
I would like to suggest that you consider Dan Castagnola as the dedicated resource.
Not only is Dan very familiar with all or a majority of our projects from both the commercial as well as the finance perspective, but in my experience working with him, he is an extremely creative and talented business person.
I would feel very fortunate to have Dan on my team.
Just a recommendation ...
Thanks, Mariella
