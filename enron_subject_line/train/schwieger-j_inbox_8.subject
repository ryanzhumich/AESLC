After more years than I care to mention, I am leaving Enron tomorrow as part of the team that's going to AEP with the sale of Houston Pipe Line Company.
I just wanted to say thanks to as many people as I could remember that helped make the time at Enron pass so quickly.
It's been great working with you!!
Best wishes
