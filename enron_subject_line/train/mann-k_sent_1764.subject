Gentlemen,  I'm attaching what we are calling an override letter to accompany the  breakout contracts.
This letter is intended to preserve the lender  requirements/accounting treatment from the WestLB agreement so long as the  equipment is a part of the financing package.
I believe we also want to address an issue regarding assignment, but we are  still discussing Mike's version internally.
Kent, I look forward to talking to you tomorrow at 300 CST.
If you would  like to discuss any of this in the am, please give me a call.
Thanks,
