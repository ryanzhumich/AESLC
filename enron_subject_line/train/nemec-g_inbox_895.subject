Please ammend our WIC contract number 41066 to have the term match up to the MDQ.
Currently the MDQ goes to 0 after November 30,2009 but the term continues with a 0 MDQ through November 30, 2013.
We would like to match up the term with the MDQ so that the term expires on Nomber 30,2009.
Your earliest attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
