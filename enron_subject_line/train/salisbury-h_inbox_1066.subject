Real Time deals typically don't get confirmed; however, Chris Foster's generation customers have requested that we confirm their deals, whether day-ahead or hour-ahead.
For us, this means we need to pay special attention to the box marked "Confirmation" when entering deals.
I know you're all in the habit of marking "No" under this designation, so review the following counterparty names carefully and commit them to memory, because deals with these generators NEED TO BE CONFIRMED.
Harbor Cogeneration 	Delano Energy 	Atlantic Richfield Co. 	Sierra Forest Products 	Wheelabrator Martell 	Wheelabrator Shasta 	Sierra Pacific Holding Co. 	Gas Recovery Systems 	East Bay MUD  Attached is a list of these counterparty names and corresponding contact information.
Feel free to print this out and keep it in a nearby notebook.
Please let Chris or me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
