Wei,  I am showing a position for the book id listed below when I query RMS Open  Positions, but I don't see the positions when I query Benchmark Agg_View.
Can you refresh the table to see if this position will pull into the  Benchmark Agg_View table?
I am including the book id, post id, and position  from yesterday.
Let me know if you need any more information.
