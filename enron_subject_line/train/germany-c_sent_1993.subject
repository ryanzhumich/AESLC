Let me know if you have questions.
I think we need to add Nov 2000.
AND, according to Navigator, the balance in storage on 1/20/2001 is  2,973,373.
Assuming ENA is owes you 40,000, the balance is 3,013,373 which  is about 49% of the total storage balance.
Is this a comfortable number or  crititcal?
Joann, are there any special storage rules for Feb and March?
Are we  required to have at least 40% in storage on 1/31/2001?
