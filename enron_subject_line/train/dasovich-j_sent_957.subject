Greetings Diane:  Well, the TeleBears on the Web seems to be experiencing some "technical  difficulties" and I've thus far been unable to register.
I'll keep trying!
In the meantime, I want to make sure that I don't miss any deadlines for the  1-unit courses.
I intend to sign up for the E291-B course (Speaking for  Management).
When do I need to sign up by?
Thanks.
Best,
