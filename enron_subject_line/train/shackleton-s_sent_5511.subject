David:  In the midst of leaving my voice mail, I think I realized my error.
I believe that a guarantor can be a "corporation,....entity" having total  asssts exceeding $10million.
However, that subpart (I) guarantor cannot be  one that falls into the subpart (III) category (which is different from the  prior law).
