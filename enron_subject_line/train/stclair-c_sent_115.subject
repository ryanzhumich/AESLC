Jeff: I spoke with Derek Davies.
He claimed that he knew nothing about his request  to us not to send the Annex A letter to the latest set of Canadian  counterparties and I made him check his e-mail for the messages that I sent  him some time ago which he did.
Anyway, he had not yet spoken with these  counterparties but promised to do so.
