In connection with an internal audit regarding the safekeeping of margin  funds and securities, Enron Corp. has asked us to provide them with a list of  all the exchanges we trade on, what rules govern those exchanges and the  products we trade on them (in particular the clearing arrangements), and any  rules that govern brokers we may maintain funds or cash with.
This should  include all the products we may trade/hedge over an exchange including energy  commodities, interest rates, currencies, equities, etc.
Can you please provide this information no later than Friday of next week.
Much thanks!
