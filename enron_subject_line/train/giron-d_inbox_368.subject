Periodically, I need some help in data gathering for analysis.
Is it possible for someone at Enron to occasionally provide the gas market data that I need?
I would like to look at the following data for 1999 and 2000 prior to our November 13 meeting.
*	Daily Henry Hub Prices *	Daily Ventura Prices *	Monthly Index Henry Hub (Inside FERC Gas Market Report) *	Monthly Index Ventura (Inside FERC Gas Market Report)  Please give me a call.
