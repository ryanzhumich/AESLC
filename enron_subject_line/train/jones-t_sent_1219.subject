I was just speaking to Edmund Cooper about various swap matters, and he  wanted me to ask the group to not make changes to his entries (for ECT  International) in the Master Swap Agreement Database.
Someone went into one  of his and added a note that the Trade Option Exemption was deleted when it  wasn't.
If you think something is in error or needs to be added, please  consult with him.
Thanks
