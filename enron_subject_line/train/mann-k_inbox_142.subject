Kay at this time MDEA has $292,544.40 that they owe us.
We have approximately $360,000  that we have made in profit according to our P&L from Risk.
At this time we are not doing any buying or selling for MDEA.
We run the load forecast, determine the position and then we get a market price from WRI.
We then call MDEA and inform them of the Market and their position.
They then tell us to buy the power from WRI.
We call WRI and they bill MDEA, not us.
We then do the tag.
