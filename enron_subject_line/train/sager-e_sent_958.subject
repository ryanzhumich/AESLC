I've spent the past 2 hours exploring each and every post office in the  armpit of southwest Houston (Enron advice) looking to simply renew my pasport  only to be intimidated by the words "no less than a 4 hour wait"   (on hard  floors) .
Any advice?
Your experience certainly must have been better.
Sad I am.
