Hi Greg,  I just wanted to mention that if we are going to bust the percentage rule on  the option payment, there is no incremental damage in having the option  payment credited to the purchase price of the land.
As for officers of the development company, I would use Dave Duran.
Ben  holds a power of attorney, but isn't an officer.
Hope you get email!
Kay
