Oscar,  I changed para 2 back to unilateral because there is no way for Enron to  have the information to issue a notice of termination on 11/30/99, only AEC  will be privy to that and in the event they do not issue notice by that date  they should remain bound to the deal.
I assume that is the only change you  made to the agreement I drafted last night.
As such I have attached the  modified version for your use with Credit prior to sending same to AEC this  morning.
