Suxzanne: Marie and I have a big fax and mailout that needs to be done this week.
We  are trying to get as much done as possible before we leave but I will need  your help today, tomorrow and Thursday to make sure this gets done.
The  clerks will be faxing and I need for you and/or Marie's assistant to check  the confirmation pages against our master list to make sure that they all  have been sent out correctly.
We are also doing a mail out.
Could you  please check with Marie Heard to see what you can do to help her out?
Thanks.
