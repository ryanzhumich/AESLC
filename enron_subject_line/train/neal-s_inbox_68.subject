Thank you for agreeing to speak at the All Accounting Offsite on May 23 at the Adams Mark Hotel.
We expect to have approximately 500 participants in the large ballroom.
We will provide a laptop and projector, so you can either send your presentation to Sharron Westbrook in advance or you can bring the file with you to load.
We plan to post the presentations on the Enron intranet after the offsite so we won't need to make hard copies available.
