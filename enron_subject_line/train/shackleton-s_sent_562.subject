We need the revised confirm now.
I'd like to review it when you're done.
I  sent the legal opinion draft to Deseret yesterday and they are sending their  draft back shortly  (I received a fax from them at 9:30 am today).
Thanks.
SS  Mike:  Do you want to see our legal opinion draft and/or Deseret's draft  opinion to be sent shortly?
