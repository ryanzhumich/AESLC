Hey girl,  I know you've been busy and I can certainly understand that!
It's been up  and down over here, but I'm hanging!
Hope everything is going well with  you.
Did the kids enjoy Halloween?
My kids sure did.
I did not realize  that we did not have rehearsal last Tuesday because of Halloween.
I wasn't  going anyway!
Don't forget I leave for Phoenix tonight for my cousin's wedding, so I'll be  back on Sunday afternoon.
Talk with you later.
