Harry:  FYI.
First meeting to discuss how to dole out the $50 MM created by  AB 970 is 10.7.
Someone I've worked with on DG-type deals in the past from  EES is going to attend the meeting (Brian Smith from the Costa Mesa office).
Bob Frank and I had a conference call with him this morning.
URL for the  event is included below.
Best,
