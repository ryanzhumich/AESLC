I talked with Rod about the purpose of the meeting.
Stan wants to start thinking about the assumptions for the 2004 rate case and a ten year Plan.
I will bring the 2002 Plan but it is really a short-term Plan and Rod does not want me to hand out anything.
It is a strategy session.
We assumed in the Plan a rate drop effective 1/1/05.
I would like to review the assumptions behind that with Teb and Blair to better understand how it was derived.
This will be one of the major issues for discussion.
