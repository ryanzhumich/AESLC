Hey team.
I just created deals 456630 (sale to New Power) and 456638 (buy from New  Power) at the pool.
This is to record the gas ENA is buying back from New  Power when there daily loads drop below the FOM numbers.
I'm using the  following FOM numbers  1st-6th  51,762 7th-26th  41,762  New Power sold back 10,000 dth day 7th-31st 27th-31st 31,762 New Power sold Aquilla 10,000 dth 27th-31st  Using these numbers, ENA is only buying back a total of 164,031dth through  the 25th.
Not as much as I thought.
