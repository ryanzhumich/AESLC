Dear Dan:  Sorry not to send the check last week as promised.
It seems that  my mom landed in a hospital in England and I had to dash out of town.
Now,  eight days later, I am just catching up.
Tomorrow (July 19) I will send the  check to you by Federal Express for Friday delivery together with my request  for a response from you to the "birthday boy".
I did receive your newsletter  - thanks very much.
Regards.
Sara
