I don't know if your directory is supposed to be the place where all the most  current GTC's are kept, but there have been some changes while you've been  gone.
I think Stacy has created  new firm GTC's, and Leslie Hansen has  revised the power to change the tax language and also change some of the  reps.
I told her to coordinate any changes she might have with David  Forster.
Janice has also been revising her forms to deal with some EFP  issues.
