At the request of Christi Nicolay, attached please find the definition of an  "Into Product" that was prepared by a group of industry participants working  with the Edison Electric Institute (EEI)  (this definition is also available  on the EEI web page).
The only other definition of an "Into" product of  which I am aware is the information that is available on the Cinergy web page  or the definition published by NYMEX for its "Into Entergy" product.
If you  have any questions about the "Into" energy product that is so commonly traded  in the over-the-counter market in the East (eg "Into Entergy", "Into TVA",  "Into Cinergy", "Into ComEd"), please don't hesitate to call me.
