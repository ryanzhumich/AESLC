Arvel,  I received your pressure data.
Unfortunately the contract pressure  is assessed against the 3 year period prior to the Effective Date of the  contract which is Oct. 19, 1993.
Any chance we would have any such data?
Ken Krisa is also checking to see if he has any such data.
Also, did we receive any quality information on Dakota production?
Thanks  for your help.
