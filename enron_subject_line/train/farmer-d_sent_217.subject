I recevied a note from Janet Wallis stating that we need Gas Daily deals for  imbalances at Colorado River Station (Mtr 8663) for Nov 99 and Mar 00.
I  changed the pricing on the term deal 72349 to Gas Daily + .199 to cover these  flows.
HC - Please have someone allocate the needed volumes to this deal ticket for  these two months, and let Katherine know when completed.
Let me know if you have any questions.
