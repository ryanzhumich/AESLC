I have taken a stab at a Legal & Privacy Statement for the Broker version of  EnronOnline.
Please take a look and let me know what you think.
Justin - I  don't know if or when they expect to launch something like this in Europe but  I expect it won't be long.
Mark G. has been working on the Broker version of  the ETA (the "BETA") and a Fee Agreement which we can send along.
