Hi Jeanine -  I have checked with Jeff Skilling's office and he is not available on June  26.
May we go back to the drawing board?
We can offer some time in the  afternoon of August 7, 8 or 9 - possibly 2:00 p.m. on one of those days.
Those dates are currently good for Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling and Dave Delainey.
Please advise at your earliest convenience.
Rosalee
