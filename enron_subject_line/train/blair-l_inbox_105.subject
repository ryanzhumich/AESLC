Hi everyone, Here we are almost at month end, and as of gas day 10/29/2001, almost all shippers need adjustments to their nominations in order to balance to zero by 10/31/2001.
OGE is about the only shipper that is totally balanced out.
Some shippers need bigger adjustments than others.
Please remind your shippers that any balance left will transferred to their Park & Ride contract where they will incur a carry-over MIC on November 1, 2001, plus they will also incur a penalty MIC on their packet for the month of October.
Thanks for your help in this matter.
