OK, let me try to catch up here.
Brent may not get my e-mail for awhile.
I  believe that he is in Houston today on personal business and will stay until  the conclusion of the ENA legal conference which is Th & Fr next week.
What  is your availability on Mon or Tues next week?
I will try to put something  together (at least you and I can have a game plan so that we can plan our  next visit to SP).
This voice stuff is a bummer.
