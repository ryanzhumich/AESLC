A copy of the 8/31/99 letter from Erik Ludtke was received at 18:10 on fax  no.
"713 646 4818" addressed to the attention of "Assistant General  Counsel".
This would conform to notices in the master agreement (for  Sections 5 and 6), an executed copy of which we have never received or seen.
On a different matter, do you think that we can discuss the omnibus templates  tomorrow?
I am pressed for a response.
