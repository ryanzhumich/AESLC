I just entered a deal in Sitara (deal 399824).
This is a sale to Transco at  St 65, 50,000/day on the 18th - 30th.
I also entered a transport usage deal  399826 for 50,000/day starting on the 18th.
This deal captures the commodity  cost to go from our St 65 pool to the SIMS pool.
Comments/Questions?
