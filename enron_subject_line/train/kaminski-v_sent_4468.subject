Charlene, I am sending you as promised the information I have about 3 of our summer  interns.
I shall fax you this morning two additional resumes I have in hard copy.
In the case of Paulo Rocha we don't have a formal resume, just a letter from him with the summary of his skills.
Thanks for your help.
Enron desperately needs this talent.
Vince
