Hey Corey,  So he's back in town now...The question is what do I do about that?
Should  I:  A) Completey ignore him and pretend like there was never anything between  us or B) Call him out and confront him with his own cowardess.
I am  completely torn on the issue and have actually felt physically ill over the  situation the last two days.
Help!!!
Susan
