On the 4/25/00 list, Imperial Oil Resources Limited (cpy id 5193) was on the  original approval list, but I had them as a U.S. counterparty instead of  Canadian.
Credit now tells me they are Canadian, so I am a little concerned  that I might have opened them for Credit Derivatives.
So if they are, shut  them down since Canadian cpys can't do Credit Derivatives.
Of course, all  counterparties should be shut down for Credit Derivatives now unless Credit  tells us they are a Credit Derivatives cpy, and then I'll make a  determination...but you know that...!
