Jeff,  Hope all is well with you.
I'm just dropping you this note to let you know I haven't forgotten your call concerning the sale of your share in the Rio house...I've been extremely busy getting my immigration status in order and setting up my company in London.
I've also asked Price Waterhouse to update all the accounts of Swanswalk Ltd in Ireland (the company that owns the house) and see the best way forward for a potential transaction seeking to minimize Brazilian and Irish taxes.
My personal matters should take me a few more weeks and I will contact you to discuss the house shortly thereafter.
Regards,
