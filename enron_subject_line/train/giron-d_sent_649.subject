Jay,  There is still some cash in the custodial accounts.
I wanted you to buy more  of the existing mutual funds.
Also, I am going to write a check out of my  CMA account for more than the current cash balance.
Do I need to sell some  mutual fund shares?
Or is it automatic?
Let me know.
Nice game in Palo  Alto.
Once again the Horns can't live up to the hype.
