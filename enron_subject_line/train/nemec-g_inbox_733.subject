Gerald,  	I wanted to get you started on this ASAP as we discussed.
I don't expect a finished product but  	preferr that you initiate the draft and I'll work with it as necessary in you absence.
Thanks for you 	cooperation.
I have attached a summary of the Parking Provision and the CSA in addition to the Term Sheet 	that is dated but you get the idea.
