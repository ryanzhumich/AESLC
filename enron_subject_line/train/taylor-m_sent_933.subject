David:  Tana and I would like to talk with you to set up the counterparty approval  process for EnronOnline regarding Australian counterparties (trading  Australian and other products) and Australian products being traded by  non-Australian counterparties.
The EnronOnline people are anxious that Tana  be designated their liaison and we need to figure out what she can do and  what you (or someone else in Australia) need to do as part of this process  going forward.
Any chance you might be available for a telephone  conversation about this at 9:00 am your time (5:00 pm Houston time) today?
Mark
