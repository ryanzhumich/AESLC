Marie: I left Mary Gosnell a message making sure that she was of what we are doing  and that she needed to provide you with any additional new counterparties  that we have done trades with since last weeks list was compiled.
Alos,  could you please give Bob Bowen a call later today or first thing tomorrow if  we haven't heard from him?
Finally, it's my understanding that the  comparison Annex A that we will attach to the letter will be the new Annex A  that has been compared to the old annex a with the name change.
Thanks.
Carol
