Eric:  I trust everything is going well as Enron.
I am actively pursuing a job out here at Mcdonalds.
"Would you like fries with that"...I practice on a regular basis.
In any case, I would like to pick up the Patriots Defense and the Steelers Defense as free agent pick ups, if still possible.
I would like to drop Engram and the Titans defense.
Please let me know.
Thanks
