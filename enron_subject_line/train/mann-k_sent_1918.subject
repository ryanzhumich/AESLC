Suzanne,  On my desk (on the window side) you will find a bound volume of a contract  for 24 turbine generator sets (between GE and a bank with a long name).
Could you please fed ex it to Peter Thompson at A&K in DC.
Peter, could you  please give Suzanne the information of where to send it.
Pete, this will give you a full set of exhibits, since you don't have  everything.
Suz, you don't have to make a copy, as I believe that copy to be an extra.
If we need a copy Pete can send us a copy later.
Thanks,
