I have received an inquiry through one of our employees (David Barr) from Chicago Partners, a consulting firm in Chicago.
They specialize, among  other things, in regulatory economics and could be useful as experts in our  discussions with the government and regulatory agencies.
One of the partners, Christopher Culp, is a well known commodity markets expert.
Please, let me know if you are interested.
