Mr. Brown: At Laird's request, I am forwarding to you a draft if the ISDA and CSA  Schedules.
We need more information from you concerning our counterparty  such as exact legal name, type of entity, state/country of incorporation  etc.
as apparently we could not tell from the financials what type of entity  it is.
This may require some changes to the enclosed drafts, but nothing  major.
We look forward to hearing from you after you have had a chance to  review the enclosed drafts.
