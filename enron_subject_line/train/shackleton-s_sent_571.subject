Before my next meeting with the Tozzini lawyers this month, I would like to  create a list of SPECIFIC products for managing Enron's Brazilian risk.
Bruce Harris is creating a list which he will forward to you shortly.
Please  review this list, comment and identify any products required for trading  prior to December 31, 1999.
Please let me hear from you if you would like to  discuss any issues in particular.
Thanks.
Sara
