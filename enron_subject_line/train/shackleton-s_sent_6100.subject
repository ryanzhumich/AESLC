Just spoke with Mark Russell.
SRP will be in Houston next week on Wednesday  and Thursday and would like to meet to discuss the ISDA with legal and  credit.
I told Mark that I was available Wed. and Thurs.
morning.
Are you  guys available at the same time?
Jay - please call me with your bond rating info so that I can email a draft  agreement to SRP.
