Mark,  I forgot to mention in my earlier note, that for the parking/storage  arrangement with Bay Gas, I would request their form of storage agreement.
I  makes more sense to have a separate agreement cover the parking arrange as  this is really independent of the compression services.
These storage  company typically have their own agreement that not bad and usually won't use  the counterparties paper.
