I notified Jim Fell and Terrell Gault of the delay in getting the documents  to them, and Jim actually said he had both the Business Plan and the EIS and  therefore didn't need either.
Hopefully the Business Plan will arrive from  BPA today and I'll send it off to Terrell.
Also, I'm sorry about the errors on the place cards.
I was in a hurry to get  them out to Sir Not-So-Speedy and overlooked those details.
I hope it didn't  cause too much confusion.
