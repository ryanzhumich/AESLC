Scott:  I just wanted to let you know that I am working on a number of  quarter-end deals and haven't heard from anyone today about the ESA swap for  Raptor 2.
I WILL NOT BE IN THE OFFICE ON FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 29.
However, I  will identify a lawyer to assist on this transaction should the need arise.
I'll be back in the office on Monday.
