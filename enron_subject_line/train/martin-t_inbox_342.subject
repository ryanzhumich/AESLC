Hi Daddy.
It's Allison.
I stayed home today.
My arm still feels about the same today.
It hurts when I get up and feels better when I lay still.
I am taking my medicine.
I will go back to school tomorrow.
I love you.
Allison     Hi Dad.
It's Matthew.
I'm doing good today.
I am taking care of Allison today.
See you later.
Matthew
