Hi, Beek.
I'm going through all of your e-mails to Jeff and am not able to find the  information on Elvis' party Friday night.
Someone had sent an attachment  with the details, but I was unable to open it.
Would you mind sending us the  "final" agenda for the festivities this weekend?
Jeff will arrive in Dallas  +/- 4:00p Friday night and will be staying at the Crescent Court hotel.
Thanks so much!
SRS
