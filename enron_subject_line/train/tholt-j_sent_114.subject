Just a little heads up.
It is going to be so cold in Omaha next week.
Will  probably hit around Tuesday.
Expect highs below zero.for about a week..
Better get your chores done this week because you are not going to want to go  outside next week..  Haven't seen it this cold since 1983.. Will encompass  the entire country.
Gas prices going through the roof.
