I've left messages describing our idea with TURN and the large  cogenerators/marketers/producers, and I've spoken with the Farm Bureau and  the California Manufacturers Association.
The Bureau and CMA agree with our  idea and I've asked them to "pass the word along" to other customer groups  and to try to ensure that its an integral part of the negotiations.
I'll be  calling other customer groups and will report back on those conversations.
Best,
