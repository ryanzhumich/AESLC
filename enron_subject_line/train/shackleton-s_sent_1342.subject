Sami:  Attached are the most recent ENA power trading agreements.
Parts of  the agreements may be useful to you and/or Jose Emilio (or whomever you are  working with).
Tozzini began with the earlier ENA template.
Please forward  any translated trading docs to my attention.
Thanks.
Let me know if there  is anything else I can do.
