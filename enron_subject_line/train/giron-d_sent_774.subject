Jay,  I want to set up a monthly automatic transfer from my checking account but  have had trouble getting a PIN number from the phone number that was mailed  to me.
I want to have $1,065 transferred into the CMA account; on the 15th  of each month if possible.
I would like $150 transferred into 226-27211 and  then used to purchase the mutual fund already in the account, $175  transferred into 226-27210 and then used to purchase the mutual fund already  in the account, and then have the remaining amount ($740) used to purchase  the mutual fund in the CMA account (226-27209).
Please help.
Thanks.
