Per my conversation with Frank, Utilicorp.
was originally shut down for  financial because it was on the original "utility" list, when we shut down  all the utilities for financial until we did the due diligence.
Since then,  we are opening the utilities up, so long as they are not governmental  utilities.
Second, we have since got an ISDA master in place with Utilicorp.
(and moved  the Aquila trades under it).
Based on the above, I am opening up Utilcorp.
for all financial products.
