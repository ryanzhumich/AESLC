Attached is the draft of ENA/EES comments to be filed Thursday in the proceeding on the complaint filed by various producers, the CPUC, SoCal Gas, and SoCal Edison against El Paso Natural Gas, alleging that El Paso has oversold its system and that full requirements contracts should be converted to CD.
Our comments agree with the complainants, illustrated by EES experiences with Southwest Gas this past winter.
If you have any comments or questions about this filing, please let me or Leslie know by close of business (5:00 pm CDT) tomorrow.
