Jana::  I am the manager of West Desk Logistics, and I would like to start  having analysts rotate into my group.
The gas trading desk director, Phillip  Allen is also very high on this idea.
Could you give me a call so we could  discuss?
I would like to get one of the new hires as quickly as possible.
My extension is 31991.
Thanks.
