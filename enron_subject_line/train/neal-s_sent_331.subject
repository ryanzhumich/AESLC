Please plan to attend an Origination Strategy meeting on Thursday 8/17 at   2:30pm.
We will be meeting with Gil Muhl, Janet Dietrich and others to discuss customer coverage, deal flow, strategic deals/customers  etc.
I think the meeting is going to held offsite  at either  the Doubletree or Hyatt.
Details to follow.
Let me know if you have any questions.
