Jason:  Here's my suggestion for item (ix) [Additional Event of Default] event on  page 2 of the Schedule:  "In the case of Party B, Enron North America Corp. .... owns less than a  majority interest in Party B unless within five (5) Local Business Days of  such occurrence, Party B posts collateral with Party A (i) in an amount equal  to Party A's Exposure under this Agreement plus $250,000, but in no event  greater than 125% of Party A's Exposure, and (ii) in a form satisfactory to  Party A in Party A's reasonable discretion.
"Exposure" shall mean for any relevant date for which Exposure is calculated,  the amount, if any, that would be payable to Party A by Party B pursuant to  Section 6(e)(ii)(2)(A) of this Agreement as if all Transactions were being  terminated as of the relevant date; provided that Market Quotation will be  determined by Party A using its estimates at mid-market of the amounts that  would be paid for Replacement Transactions (as that term is defined in the  definition of "Market quotation") in order to ensure that Party A does not  suffer an economic penalty."
I think that we agreed on everything else.
Please send new blackline.
Thanks.
Sara
