Hi Steve,  We need wiring instructions for the account that will receive the $ from  escrow.
It should be an  account where money goes in and out in one day.
Can you track down the info?
We are waiting for the lenders to comment on the proposal that they will  close once we deliver our deliverables.
Stay tuned!
Kay
