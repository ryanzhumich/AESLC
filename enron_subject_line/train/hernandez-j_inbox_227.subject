Attached is a short memo and summary outlining changes to the Business School Loan Program for the Western Hemisphere.
As many of you know, over the past couple of months we have taken a hard look at our approach to business school loans.
The updated guidelines better serve Enron's business interests, eliminate credit exposure for the company, and potentially broaden the reach of the Loan Program.
If you have any questions, please contact Ted Bland (x35275) who leads Career Development for the Program.
