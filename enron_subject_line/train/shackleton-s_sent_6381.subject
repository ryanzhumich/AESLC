All:  I will be on vacation until October 16, 2000.
Because I am handling a  large number of brokerage agreements and electronic trading platforms (for  ENA and ECT Investments, Inc.), I have asked Jason Peters with Andrews and  Kurth (713-220-4124) to assist me.
Some of the agreements are for John  Greene who is currently in London and those agreements may reference English  law and the Financial Services Acts.
I have given Jason your names IN CASE  he has any questions.
Thanks for your help.
Sara
