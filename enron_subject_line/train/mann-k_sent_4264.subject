I'm thinking my last email was unclear.
I assume that someone from the commercial team will send (or has sent) the  extension letter to MDEA, YC, and Clarksdale's commercial reps for their  review.
I assume that the  commercial reps with YC, MDEA, and Clarksdale  will get whatever legal input they want from their own lawyers if they think  it is necessary (may not), but as a courtesy, I sent drafts to the two  lawyers I know about.
