FYI,  Please book all future GD priced tiered deals as two deals in sitara.
The  reason for this is eventhough we put a swap on the deal for the volume that  should be at index, the swap looks at the volume as a monthly volume as  opposed to a daily and gives the monthly volume to the desk at mid.
What  typically happens is the total volume for the first half of the month comes  to the desk entirely at mid.
This is causing some substantial OA variances.
If you have any questions, please let me know.
Thanks.
