Just to clarify - you are booked in the Mt.
Bachelor conference room for your  Monday morning staff meetings, 9 to 10:15 a.m., from now until this time next  year.
Hopefully this will eliminate any last minute confusion like what we  ran into this morning.
If you have any other questions, please let Mollie or  myself know and we'll address them as quickly as possible.
Thank you -
