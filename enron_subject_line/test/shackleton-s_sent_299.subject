Per my fax (37 pages) of 8/29/99, attached are copies of (1) the existing and  proposed Annex A (general terms for the omnibus) and (2) proposed option  formats for ISDA and omnibus.
My purpose was to "ISDAize" the omnibus  particularly in the cap/floor/collar world.
Please note the Par.2 Payment  section and revised definitions.
You do not have "old" confirm templates  because I cannot acces on my computer (but all was included in the fax).
Did  you receive the fax?
