i want to make sure that the current bid of $12,115 for a round trip to turks  and caicos is correct.
i would also like to find out what landing fees,  international taxes and/or overnight hanger fees i will have to pay if i book  this trip.
the note at the bottom of the "view trips" page also says that  bids are subject to availability.
will availability be confirmed at the time  i book the trip?
or will i have to wait some period of time to find out?
