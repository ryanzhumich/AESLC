Per Steve's request, I am forwarding a phone number of a consulting company  that produces maps which show all pipeline in Texas (sorted by county).
This  might be a good place to start to find the pipeline you described in your  voice mail to Steve.
The company is Design Technics Corp.
Phone: (713) 460-2291.
The map will  generally show where the pipeline runs, but it is depicted at more of a macro  level.
