In order for Cadwalader to be in a position to order lien searches, please e-mail Lech Kalembka (Lech.Kalembka@cwt.com) the initial draft of your Master Netting Agreement(s).
When your agreement is finalized, please e-mail Lech a copy of the final draft so that he can prepare the financing statement filings.
Thanks!
