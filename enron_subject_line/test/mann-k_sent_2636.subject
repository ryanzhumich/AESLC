Here's what Eric wrote:   I revised the contract you sent me to make it site specific.
Those changes  are redlined.
Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and 10.4.3  as well as the defined terms that go with them.
These were related to  exhaust temperature and energy.
I know this is a simple cycle plant and they  typically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would guarantee it  anyway.
It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes combined  cycle.
If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that out,  then they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 (and  their defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust  guarantees.
Let me know what they decide.
Exhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached to  your file.
(It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.)
I  therefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it.
It is now attached as a  separate word file.
Exhibit F is "boiler plate" and shouldn't change.
Exhibit "U" is not in my  hard copy.
My copy only goes up to Exhibit "T."   If you get something from  GE on Exhibit "U", send it to me and I will be glad to review it.
