Attached are my accomplishments for the first half of 2000.
I should have  had these for you on Tuesday for your PRC.
Hopefully, better late than  never.
I am not certain how the coporate-wide PRC process will work in late  July for VP's.
I have provided a copy of this to Dave Delainey for the ENA  PRC which will take place on July 7.
I thought that I would provide you a  copy as well.
I will also have Patti deliver a hard copy to Sharron next week.
