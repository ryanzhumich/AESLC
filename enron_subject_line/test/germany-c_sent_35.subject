Don't forget to chat with VNG about Nabisco.
VNG should have released 700 dth of CGAS capacity to Nabisco effective  11/1/2000 - 10/31/2001.
Nabisco was not set up as a prearranged bidder at  the time.
During Nov bidweek for Dec, Nabisco asked me to release the  capacity.
Since the term was less than 1 year, I couldn't release the  capacity non-biddable.
I spoke to Jeff Huston about it early last week and  he said he would get back to me.
Dick suggested I tell you.
TAGG - you're  it, I will await your command.
Mr. Scott Goodell said we could release the  capacity for 1 year eff 1/1/2001 and then recall Nov and Dec.
