Forgot to tell you that Joe and I went to see the Jim Rome show when he was  in Houston a couple of weeks ago .
It was pretty good.
Too bad you'll never  see him in Omaha.
Guess what else?
We got a memo today that Enron is giving  all of its employees a home  computer and will subsidize their internet  connection.
Gift is part of their commitment to techonology.
Does your  company do this with your telephones?
