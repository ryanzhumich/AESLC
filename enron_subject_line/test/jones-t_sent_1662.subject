In the future, if we have a city or a county come through, we need to  identify the state they are located in as part of the counterparty name.
The  City of Huntsville is an example where I took it to be the the City of  Huntsville, TX, and, per my conversation with Tom today, it appears they are  the City of Huntsville, AL.
This isn't going to be a problem with my  financial approval, since I shut down all cities for financial unless we have  a master in place, but it might be a problem for power.
The same would apply  to counties.
So, if we get cities and counties in, let's try and make the state part of  the counterparty name.
Leslie, do you have any problem w/Huntsville, let me know?
