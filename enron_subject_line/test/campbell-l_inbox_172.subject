As most of you know, American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles was hijacked yesterday and then crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York.
We are very sorry to report that we believe an Enron employee was on board that flight.
Nick Humber, a director in Enron Wind's commercial origination group, was listed on the flight's manifest, and although his family has not received official confirmation that he boarded the flight, they have been unable to contact him.
Nick was based in Boston and was traveling to Los Angeles for a meeting.
We have talked with Nick's family and offered our full support.
Please continue to keep Nick's family and everyone affected by this horrific event in your thoughts and prayers.
