I received an email this morning regarding the reports viewer.
I agree with  restriciting the access to these sensitive reports, but I don't agree with  removing myself from those allowed to review positions.
I not only run one  of the largest financial books on the floor, but I also manage the West  physical book.
Phillip Allen passed on the IM WEST physical book to me two  months ago.
While Phillip acts as manager of the sub books in the west, I am  managing all physical positions.
