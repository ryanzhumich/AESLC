Well, we met and had dinner last night.
NOTHING of importance was discussed  during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were  leaving that any actual talking occurred.
Here are the basics...  - There is definitely no "us" anymore...and I quote "sometimes these things  just fade out" - There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still  don't - Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married) - Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he  hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond       2 mos.
in those three  years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated a lot) - Can you say  issues?
- He told me "I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do  with you, it's all me."
Of course I agreed with him saying "I know it's you  Ted, I don't have any problems."
(He got a chuckle out of that one) - I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled  things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at  Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of  things in the beginning - I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he  hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e.
murder a family member, etc.)
I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed.
- He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still enjoyed hanging out and  talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that)  So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1.
A lightened  load (I got everything of my chest that I wanted to and needed to) 2.
My  dignity (I handled it just as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3.
A  clearer since of Ted as a person (He definitely has a lot of issues in his  life he has not completely dealt with yet, and who knows if he ever will?)
Anyway, I'm okay with everything and surprisingly feel pretty good.
I'll  talk to you soon.
Susan  By the way, I told him about the shirt idea (he thought it was funny, and  maybe just a little harsh)

You hit the nail on the head...he is a weirdo.
