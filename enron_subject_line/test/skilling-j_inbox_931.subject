I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.
We obviously have a lot to talk about.
Last week we reported third quarter earnings.
We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.
Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.
I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.
As usual, I will be as candid as I can.
I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.
I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.
