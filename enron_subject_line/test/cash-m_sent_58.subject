Hello!
An ENA employee wrote a book that was published in Russia.
There have been  three editions, and the publisher wants her to do a 4th.
The topic is  technical analysis, which is what she does here at Enron.
In this 4th  edition, she will be using public data, her own PC, and working on her own  time.
However, given that she has been at Enron for 6 months, she obviously  would apply some of the knowledge she has gained here in the revision of the  book.
She would not divulge any Enron confidential or proprietary  information, however.
What are your thoughts on whether she could be able to do this?
She is  willing to let Enron be a co-author, although as a practical matter, I do not  think that would be worthwhile.
My opinion at this point is that she can do  it, so long as it is on her own time and using her own resources, and, of  course, provided that she reveals no Enron-specific  information.
I welcome  your perspective, however, given that this is a new one to me.
Thanks for your thoughts.
