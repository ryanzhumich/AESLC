I have two Australian counterparties on the referenced list, State  Electricity Commission of Victoria and Straits Resources Limited, and I  haven't heard from you, and I need to get that list out.
When you send your  approval, can you be specific as to whether they are approval for Australian  products only, or all products.
Thanks!
