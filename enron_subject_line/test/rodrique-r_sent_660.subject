Kathy,  I spoke with the system administrators today and they gave me several more  guidelines for the text files.
1) The Book ID must be an existing book (Please use the same book id every  day).
Also please Sort the Book Id by risk type (ie IMCan-Erms-xl-GDL, then  IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PHY, then IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PRC.)
2) The Master Deal Id must be a unique number per line.
3) The reference date must be in the following format D-MMM-YY.
4) MTM Value Amount must be a NUMBER.
If there is no position please use a  zero.
5) The GROSS POSITION and DELTA POSITION must be a value.
No commas, no  dashes, no links, and no #REF errors.
Again if there is no position please  use a zero.
The guidelines apply to all text files that must be loaded into GRMS.
If you  have any question, please give me a call.
Thanks,
