The mad cow disease must have extended to England's venerable sheep, thus  causing a lack of worsted wool, hence, no new trousers which, I'm sure, is  the only reason we haven't gotten a fashion bulletin from you in quite some  time.
The men's fashion news here in the United States says that the current  fashion in ladies pedal pushers (or knee length trousers) has now extended to  the gents and is becoming quite the rage.
Fashion trends are quite slow in  reaching the outbacks here in Texas, but I can see fashionable young swains  in London and New York showing off their knees and ankles.
Has this trend  crossed the Atlantic?!
Has Justin bought a pair in red?
We miss our Tim from Texas....stay in touch!
