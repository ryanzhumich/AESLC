Dawn,  Doesn't it suck to be at work and know that someone else is out of the  country?
I just want to let you know how much I suffered while you were  gone.
I realize now just how bad you must want out of this group.
Without  you or Jennifer there was no real conversation the whole week!!
Chris just  works quietly.
Jason interrupts the quiet with inane comments that I have no  idea how to respond to.
And Anne...well I can't even explain that.
Let me digress for just a moment to talk about work.
Nothing really  happened.
All was quiet.
If anyone was upset about anything they didn't  tell me about it.
I did get an email from Frank Cernseck(or how ever you  spell his name).
It seems we took too much as broker fees in July.
I  haven't researched it, but from what Victor tells me that's an adjustment  that needs to be made on last day P&L.
I'm sure I'm not telling you anything  you don't know.
Just wanted to let you know I'm glad you're here and I'm not.
Hope you enjoyed your trip.
Robin
