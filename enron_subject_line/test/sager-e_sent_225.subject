Hi  We are so bad - we suddenly woke up and realized that Friday is December  1st.
That means Saturday is the 2nd - Sam's birthday.
SO I'm writing  invitations now.
Here it is:   Can Eleanor and Alice join us on Saturday for a train party at the zoo?
Around 10:00?
We would love to have you all come too, or not, if you prefer  to  ..... shop.
PS Hope your holidays were, well, a holiday.
