Ben,  Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.
One issue is when this transaction can close.
Since the equipment is owned  by WestLB and since the feeling is we don't want to involve WestLB in the  transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the  WestLB facility.
If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle  back with Lisa.
A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both  ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for  payment for changes, storage, etc.
As far as I know, this concept hasn't  been addressed with GE.
I re-calculated the overhead charge, so you might want to check it out.
I look forward to your comments.
Kay
