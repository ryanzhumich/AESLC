We just opened the above counterparty to trade UK financial crude products  online.
Since the Enron counterparty for these products is ECTRIC we will  need to get a master in place between ECTRIC and Counterparty.
Justin Boyd  in London has graciously agreed to let us handle drafting and negotiation of  the master.
Could you please provide us with credit for this master.
I  don't know if we can just mirror the credit terms in the old master or not.
Since the old master is a Local Currency Master, we cannot do a simple dupe  and change it for UK issues.
I would suggest unless we really have problems  with issues, we more or less try to sign the same paper whenever possible.
Of course, send the credit worksheet for the new master to the paralegals for  the rotation.
