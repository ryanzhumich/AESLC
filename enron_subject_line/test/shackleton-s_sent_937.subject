Patricia:  I was wondering if you had an opportunity to speak with any  persons associated with the Argentine Derivatives Association in connection  with our discussion of last week.
I can't recall if you were going to try to  speak with the lawyers for Citibank and/or Morgan to determine whether the  ADA might welcome our participation in the association, and specifically,  with respect to the template currently in circulation.
I think you were also  going to attempt to locate a current membership list for the association.
Please advise when you have further information.
I am trying to plan several trips to Argentina and Brazil.
I am considering  a trip to BA during the week of February 28.
Will you be in town that week?
During my visit, my tax colleague from Houston and I will try to meet with  local tax consultants and organizations lobbying for tax reformation.
Regards.
Sara
