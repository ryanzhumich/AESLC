Ryan,  In the follow up to the meeting we had on Wednesday I would like to reinforce one point I made.
I feel strongly that I cannot support the valuations my group has produced so far for the LJM/Raptor related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents.
I feel that we did solid work based on verbal information,  but I cannot guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts.
These transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements  that you would expect from any professional.
