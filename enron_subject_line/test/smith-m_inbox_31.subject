Dear TurboTax Customer:  The status of your electronically filed federal tax return is now available from the IRS.
You must view this status to determine whether or not the IRS has accepted your return.
To get your status:  TurboTax software users - Open your TurboTax program and we'll show you how to obtain the status of any returns you have filed electronically.
TurboTax for the Web users - Log on to TurboTax for the Web and we'll show you how to obtain the status of any returns you have filed electronically.
If the IRS has accepted your electronically filed return, TurboTax will walk you through the remaining tasks you must complete before the IRS considers your tax return officially filed and complete.
Please follow the instructions in TurboTax carefully.
If your return is rejected, you must fix the errors in your return and retransmit your return for approval.
NOTE:  If you have filed a state return electronically, you will receive a separate email notification once TurboTax has received the status from the state taxing authority.
For more information on how to check the status of your return, please refer to the Help section of TurboTax.
Thank you for using TurboTax.
