I received word from the TNRCC that they will allow a portable emissions test  at the Spraberry C/S to confirm that the replacement of the fuel mixers with  carbureators will not cause an increase in emissions.
I will send out the  letter today to the TNRCC reqesting written approval to do the testing.
I  would strongly recommend that the Spraberry Team have the sampling ports  installed on the unit that they select to be tested and have this testing  completed ASAP.
Remember, the unit selected must be tested with the fuel  mixer on and then remove the mixer and conduct a test with the carbureator  on.
Whoever performs the portable emissions testing will need to ensure that  we follow a portocol that I will submit to the state.
