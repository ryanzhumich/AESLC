We will need to be packed and ready to move for WEDNESDAY, 02/06/02 & THURSDAY, 02/07/02.
The move team will be moving our group during the day and the stenos will NOT be working until Monday, 02/11/02.
Also, please make sure that we LOGOFF again tonight...the IT group could not migrate us over the weekend due to incomplete items with legal.
They are going to try and take care of the migration tonight for the new UBS systems.
Thanks for your help.
