Kay:  I left you a voice mail yesterday at Sheila's suggestion regarding  Midwest.
Greg and I discussed the use of ENA's format of ISDA documentation  by Midwest and I have a couple of questions about how our docs will be used,  whether Midwest will be competing with us and who will be negotiating hedge  agreements on behalf of Midwest (i.e., will ENA swap lawyers be involved?).
Please call me so that I can comply with Greg's request..
Thanks.
Sara
