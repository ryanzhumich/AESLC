I didn't get back from the meeting with Causey and Buy until just before 6:00  today - not that the meeting was long - Rick Causey was just running late so  we cooled our heels outside his office for quite a while before getting  started.
I decided that midnight would be outside the bounds of office  dedication, so I did not call!
Enjoy your time off tomorrow and on Monday.
My plans are to take off next week, and to be back in the office to work the  week between Christmas and New Years.
I wouldn't recommend taking your time  during your day off to call, but if you finish your Christmas shopping and do  want to call, my calendar is free all afternoon after lunch tomorrow.
Wish I  could send you with a shopping list for me!
