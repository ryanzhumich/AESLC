Steve, apparently I'm developing an overactive imagination when it comes to  FERC decisions.
In Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, 74 FERC ?
61,102, reh'g denied, 75  FERC ?
61,272 (1996), and Transwestern, 90 FERC P 61,044, in which FERC  approved LFT services, the Commission accepted the pipelines' statements that  they would not sell capacity that is not available (i.e., will not  double-sell), rather than limit the service in some way or reject the filings.
In Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., 79 FERC ?
61,394 (1997), the  Commission approved of the pipeline's selling of capacity that becomes  operationally available for various reasons from time to time.
But I have not been able to locate the general statement along the lines of  "pipelines can use their own discretion to determine whether capacity is  available" that I thought existed.
