Further to my message of yesterday evening, I have spoken with the MSCS  lawyer in London and learned that EnronCredit.com Limited ("ECCL") has  finalized its ISDA Master Agreement and CSA with MSCS.
ECCL is awaiting the  ENE guaranty.
The lawyer is forwarding docs to me this morning and I  understand they were heavily negotiated.
Tanya, will you be handling credit for both ENA and ENE?
I would like to  chat with whomever is handling today, if possible.
I will forward ECCL to  you both when I receive.
Thanks.
