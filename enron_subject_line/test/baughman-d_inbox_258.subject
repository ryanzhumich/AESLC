At this time I will need a hard copy of the for for set up .
All should be receiving a for on your door this week.
They are due before November 17th.
Arch Committee Report  Setup December 1st - Takedown January 5th  Arch Setup is scheduled for Saturday (December 1) with completion on Sunday (December 2) if needed.
I have a few volunteers that have stated they willing to help on those days but as always could use more.
I will have a short meeting with the volunteers at my house on Thursday before setup.
The more help the faster we can complete the Holiday Decorations.
Last year we where able to setup the arches in one day.
I would like to do the same this your.
Men ,Women, and Teens are asked to help.
The process consists of assembly of the arch (men needed), tie the light onto the arch with plastic ties (anyone) and then erecting the Arch (4 men).
We will divide up in to due teams that will move down the street performing their part.
Clean holes if needed, assemble arches, check lights, attach lights to arches, retest lights and stand arch At least one experiences arch volunteer from last year will be on each team as the lead .
If we get an early star we can complete the setup in one day.
I would like to start at 8:30 am on Saturday (Dec.1).
We can meet at the Church at 8:00 am and delegate duties to groups We will leave from the Church at 8:30 am and start the setups.
Those helping may want to bring a pair of gloves and wire cutters or side cutters for the ties.
O' yes, for those that helped last year, we will have the chicken gumbo again.
I hope that is OK.  We would like to have all setup fees in before setup day.
I will have a mailbox in front of my house to drop the fee in with your setup form.
If you do not send in your form and would like to have your arch setup we will except the fee on Saturday of setup.
This fee collection is time consuming and would like not have to deal the fee on setup day.
It is the residents responsibility to have the arch parts accessible by 8:30am on the setup Saturday.
We will have extra light strings for those that need to purchase replacements.
If you would like to have your Arch set up please have the following items completed and ready by Saturday (December 1).
Requirement for Setup of existing Arches:  All Arch holes will need to be cleaned, by washing out with water prior to setup day.
All Arch pieces will need to be places at Arch hole of the resident (Arch Partner) that will plug in the lights.
All lights are to be tested and bad lights replaced.
Bulbs available at Hobby Lobby.
Extension cord laid out for light check prior to Arch Erection.
All arch parts accessible by 8:30am Saturday Dec.1.
I cannot believe that it is already November and we need to be ready for Chirstmas in the Village.
Craig and the arch team can use our help.
Let him know if you can lend a hand.
