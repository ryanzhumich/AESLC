On January 13, 2000, FERC issued a Section 7(c) certificate for  Transwestern's Gallup Expansion.
The Commission's order contained two  conditions:  1) that Transwestern file its discounted rates within 15 days of  the order, and 2) that Transwestern restructure its relationship with Enron  Compression Services so that Transwestern will have sufficient operation  control over the motor at the Gallup compressor station to assume regulatory  responsibility for the motor's operation, and that Transwestern file a report  with the Commission stating how it complied with this condition.
Transwestern accepted the  certificate January 14, 2000 but reserved the  right to seek rehearing or clarification of the order.
On January 18, 2000,  Transwestern filed a motion for extension of time to comply with the  condition that Transwestern file its discounted rates.
Transwestern has  already filed with the Commission the discounted rates it will charge its  expansion shippers, subject to a request for confidentiality.
Transwestern  intends to file a request for rehearing of the January 13 order explaining  why the Commission erred in ordering Transwestern to publicly disclose its  discounted rates in advance of the normal time for making such disclosure  through a discount report.
