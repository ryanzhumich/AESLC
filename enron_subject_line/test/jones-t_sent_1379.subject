I discussed this w/Frank, and wanted to make the other two of you aware,   since this is a Bermuda corporation, they are only allowed to trade the US  segment of bandwidth.
Since this is the only segment we are trading online  yet, this isn't an issue.
But as we move forward and add more segments we  are going to have to keep in mind that although a counterparty may have been  open for US, we need to consider if they can trade other country based  segments as we add them in the future.
