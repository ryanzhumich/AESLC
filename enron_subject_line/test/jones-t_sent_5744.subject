Per our meeting, attached are the current forms of MAC Clauses.
I have added  at the end of the list, the Event of Default for change in ownership because  I know that one comes up frequently.
Also, I don't know if you want to also  suggest that the other trading groups work from our guaranty forms as well as  our LC form.
The Legal heads of each of the trading groups are:  Mark Taylor:  Financial Trading Jeff Hodge:  Physical Gas Trading Elizabeth Sager:  Physical Power Trading Alan Aronowitz:  Physical Global Markets (Liquids, Plastics, Coal, Emissions  & Metals) Julie Murray:  Physical Industrial Markets (Pulp & Paper, Steel)
