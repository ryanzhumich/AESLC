On September 24, 2001, Alice gave each of you a list of your outstanding accounts receivable 	back to January, 1998.
In meeting with Alice today, I understand, we have NOT cleaned up very 	many of these issues.
Alice will be getting with each one of you AGAIN to review your accounts.
My expectation is 	that there has been some clean up activity before Performance Reviews at which time I will 	ask Alice for an update.
Alice, Raetta and Larry are all available as needed to help you in 	this effort.
All clean up should be completed by December 31, 2001.
