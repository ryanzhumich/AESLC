What's this - according to Navigator, we only have this contract for 1 day on  Feb 23rd?
I just entered it in the ces retail sheet.
MDQ = 5000 and the  rate is $.01?
Who did this deal?
The receipt points are Exxon-Chalkley, NGPL, and Tenn-Egan.
The delivery  point is Rayne.
It looks like we nominated gas on this contract.
I'm  setting up this up in Sitara and on our 2000tran02.xls worksheet and I  entered it in Sitara deal 223022.
Jesse, this will need to be scheduled in Unify.
