Gary/Susan,  It came to our attention yesterday that the PWR-GAS-LT-MGMT-PRC book is  included in the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio.
This book is officalized by Jenny  Latham and the position is not reported on the benchmark.
Therefore, I don't  believe it should be included in the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio.
Also please  ensure that this book is not included in the AGG-GAS portfolio.
Thanks,
