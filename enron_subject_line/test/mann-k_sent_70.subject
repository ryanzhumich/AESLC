Gentlemen,  I have made changes to the consolidation agreement, which I hope all will  find acceptable:    (It does need a date or two.)
As for the termination agreement, here's what I suggest:    Do we want to address the purchaser's parent guaranty in both of the  contracts, or just the consolidation agreement?
I would suggest that we make  the guaranty a deliverable 30 days after execution of the contracts, which  gives us time to get the Mitsui assignment done, as we expect to assign the  contracts immediately.
That way, Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if  necessary.
If ENA does provide the guaranty, we would want to have the  ability to have it replaced with a suitable substitute guaranty from Mitsui.
Sorry I missed your call.
It was a day of meetings.
I will be on the road  tomorrow, but will check my voice mail.
Kay
