Hi Melissa,  Thanks for the call.
I thought it might be easier to communicate via email  since we are both kind of difficult to reach via phone.
Sounds like they  keep you busy at V&E.
Yes, I do work for Enron.
I am an attorney for Enron North America in gas  and power origination.
I actually worked with some attorney's from V&E on a  couple of asset financing deals we did about a year ago.
Terry Yates and  David Keyes.
Joel Ephross also worked on those deals, but he is now at Enron  in our Global Finance Legal Group.
Sounds like you have worked alot on Enron deals.
I know we keep you guys  pretty loaded with work.
Who are your Enron contacts?
Enron is a big place,  but I might know them.
Lunch sounds great.
The 14th works for me.
Any preferences as to location?
In case you were wondering about how Ann Wukasch and I know each other; Ann  and I met at my sister's wedding in Colorado.
My sister and Ann are good  friends and work at the same school in Dallas.
Ann is a trip!
Gerald
