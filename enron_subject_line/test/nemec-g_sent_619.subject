How is it going?
Did you have a fun weekend?
My weekend was, although  enjoyable,  challenging.
First Eric's wife got sick Friday night and wasn't  able to go out the whole weekend.
Next, my car battery completely died when  I arrived at my friends house in Austin.
I replaced the battery and  everything was fine.
Eric, I,  and my friend proceeded to Maggie Maes to see  the band Pale (the whole point of our trip, right!).
We arrived at Maggie  Maes and asked which level Pale was playing on and were informed they had  cancelled.
Great.
Oh well we had a good time that night anyway.
Cool.
Then, driving back to Houston and coming up upon the Beltway I noticed that  my temp gauge needle was buried deep into the danger zone.
I had to have the  car towed back into downtown.
Anyway, it was an interesting trip.
