Jeff,  A few comments on the model:  1.
We have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like  to discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of  our insights to the consultant.
In general, the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the  details and in the inputs and calibration.
The same model may produce drastically different results  depending on the quality of inputs.
2.
We don't have a separate pool of programmers in the Research  Group.
We  were told that you would provide an IT resource.
Alex would supervise this person.
