I had a conversation with Ed Staub over at Duke today, and he now wants to  get an agreement in place between Duke and ENA.
I mentioned to him our  agreement between ENA and ECC that would allow us to trade both entities  under the same master, and he was not interested in trading in that manner,  he wants separate agreements in place with both companies, obviously,  mirroring the terms of the master we are putting in place with ECC, just  changing it for any cross-border issues.
I told him I would run it by our  Credit Dept.
