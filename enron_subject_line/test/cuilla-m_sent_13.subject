The winner of the 9/15 Dave Matthews Tickets accidently bid on both pairs of  tickets I had for sale (9/15 and 9/16) and only wanted one pair.
He is  buying the 9/16 tickets (11th row) for $345.
If you are interested in the  9/15 tickets (8th row) which are even better seats, I can sell them to you  for $305.
Let me know asap because I am leaving town around 2pm for the  weekend.
You can reach me at work or anytime this weekend on my cell phone.
If you are interested please call me at 713-853-5933 (work) or 713-516-8820  (cell) and we will work it out.
FYI - I am also notifying the person who bid  $305 and promised to give them first look but otherwise the tickets are your  if you want.
Thanks,
