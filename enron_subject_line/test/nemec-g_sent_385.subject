Attached is a draft for your review.
Please review and lets discuss any  comments.
After re-reading the purchase and gathering agreement, I think the  amendments should work in their present form.
The 2,500 Western gas needs to  be noted as an exception on Exhibits A of both Agreements.
Exception should  read "Up to the first 2,500 mmbtu/day of production from the Caballo Area  shall be delivered to Western.... with ENA  (or EMS as applicable for the  agreement) receiving all volumes in excess of such 2,500 mmbtu/day.
Any  decline in the Caballo Area production shall apply ratably between Western's  2,500 mmbtu/day and ENA's (or EMS as applicable for the agreement) production  levels."
I got my mind on my money and my money on my mind.
