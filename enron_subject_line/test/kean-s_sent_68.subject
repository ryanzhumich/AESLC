Want to have fun?
Want to get on a game show?
Want to help Millions?
Tomorrow you will receive an email that allows you to answer 15 questions via  email responses (about United Way, Enron, and other fun items).
Participation with correct answers puts you in the drawing for the employees  to represent Corp. in a "Who wants to be a Millionaire?"
game that will be  played to benefit United Way on August 9.
The lucky and smart  representatives will be playing for great prizes.
I encourage your participation in the game, but more importantly, encourage  your generous participation in Enron's United Way campaign.
Thanks for your  help and HAVE FUN!
