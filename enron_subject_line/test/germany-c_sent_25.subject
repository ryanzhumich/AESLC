I added a demand charge of $1,193,725 to deal 523459 for Dec 2000.
I don't  think this should show up in the current month P&L, at least not from this  deal ticket.
Let me know if there are any problems.
This demand charge is for the Market East and for the $10,000/month  scheduling fee.
We are still working on the East demand charges for New  Power.
