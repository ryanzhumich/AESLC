i'm sorry if i am not being understanding about this situation, but i if you  really look back at the last 5 jobs you've had, i think i have been more than  understanding about letting you do whatever you wanted to do.
it really  hurts me that your pride in this situation is more important to you than  spending time with your pregnant wife and your daughter.
i can't talk to you  about this anymore if you are unwilling to understand my point of view.
once  again, if the situation were different, i would tell you to do whatever you  wanted.
but, this time it's different and i hope you can see that.
i love  you!
