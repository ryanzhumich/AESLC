Effective today, there is a new legal review procedure for physical power  contracts that are individually negotiated, with a term longer than one  year.
Please notify me (Janette will maintain a list of contracts,  counterparties and status) when drafting starts on such power contracts and  provide me with a draft with sufficient time to make comments prior to  closing.
My objective is to insure a consistent approach on these power  contracts.
Thanks for your cooperation in this matter.
Please forward this  memo on to the lawyers on your team.
