Greetings:  On the call between Ken Lay and Bob Hertzberg, Hertzberb asked us to resend  any thoughts (and any more detail) we have on demand buy-downs.
I've  combined our on-line auction proposal with the "federal" solution recently  worked up for the Cheney meetings (I tailored it for California  consumption).
Hertzberg wanted it today in advance of meetings that he's having in  Washington next week.
Scott Governor will deliver this to Hertzberg's office  today.
Sorry for quick turn around, but if folks have comments, could you  send them to me pronto so that Scott can deliver to Hertzberg's office before  COB?
Thanks very much.
Best,
