Shari:  I need your thoughts on 2 things:  We have done another trade with this counterparty on the Omnibus form and  Jaryd informed me that as part of the first trade, we agreed to some  modifications to our Annex A.
Do you remember what those modifications  were?
Also, we are now using our new form of Annex A.
How do you think that  this counterparty will react to getting a new form?
I loook forward to  hearing from you.
Carol
