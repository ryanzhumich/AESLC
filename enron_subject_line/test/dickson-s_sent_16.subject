I have asked Pat Radford to put the enovate Master Firm and the enovate GISB  in Attorney's Forms.
Until she is able to do that, you can find these forms  as follows:  1) The Master Firm is at o/common/legal/sdickso/enovate/enovate master  firm.doc 2) The GISB is at o/common/legal/sdickso/enovate/enovateGISB.doc  Please let me know if you have any problems locating these documents.
