Update on Mail Distribution:  On Campus Mail Distribution Resumes  On-campus mail distribution resumed this afternoon (11/14/01).
Initial distribution may be slow but is expected to pick up as mail that had been stored in a secured campus facility is processed.
Pending the reopening of the University's Main Post Office in the Administration Building, the mail sorting and distribution activity is taking place at an alternate site in the University Service Center.
University facilities that receive mail directly from the United States Post Office will continue to receive and process mail.
The test results were negative for the East (Divinity) Campus mail facility and mail distribution for that Campus resumed this afternoon.
The West (Law) Campus is processing mail from an alternate location while they await the results of tests taken at their main processing location.
With the exception of Meridian Hill Hall, for which results are pending, the off-campus dormitories also received negative test results and this afternoon reactivated distribution from their usual locations.
