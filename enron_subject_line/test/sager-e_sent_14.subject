Hi Alex  THANKS - Ella rec'd the bathing suit and loves it.
She put it on and  wouldn't take it off.
Perfect size.
Perfect gift.
WE ARE COMING - hope that's still OK.  We finally booked our flight to NY.
We are planning on coming up on Sat.
July 22nd and leaving on Sunday the  30th.
Not sure of the plans from there but will call you later.
If this  doesn't work for you guys, let me know.
SO EXCITED about coming.
Talk to you soon.
