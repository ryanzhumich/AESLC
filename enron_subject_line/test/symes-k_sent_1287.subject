I just entered an index deal for one of our traders, and came across  something I hadn't noticed before.
In EnPower, we have several choices for  the Dow Jones Mid-Columbia index, but none called specifically "Mid-C Firm  Peak."
We have non-firm peak, and something called "Mid-Columbia Index."
I'm just wondering how to specify that I want the deal to settle against the  Dow Jones Mid-C PEAK index.
In this case, because I was entering a  round-the-clock (all hours, all days) deal, I had to enter three different  deals to specify the three different indices - Mid-C Peak, Mid-C Off Peak,  and Mid-C Sundays and Holidays.
But I don't see a Mid-C Peak choice, so I  entered the first as Mid-C Index.
Deal numbers are: 597244 - Peak 597245 - Off Peak 597246 - Sundays/Holidays  I just wanted to ask because when you guys plug the index prices in here I  want to make sure that "Mid-C Index" gets the peak price.
Could you let me  know if it doesn't?
And if that's the case, then I'll need to have another  pub code set up for peak price.
Thanks for your help on this.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
