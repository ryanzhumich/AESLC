I wanted to extend my thanks in advance to all of you who will join me in the  office on January 1, 2000.
I appreciate your willingness to devote part of  your holiday weekend to the continuing success story at Enron.
As a company, Enron has spent much time and effort to ensure that business  will continue smoothly as we move into the year 2000.
Ken Walther, in  working with many of you, has done an excellent job of preparing a work plan  for January 1.
Your  work on the first  will be the final step in this  process.
Your efforts that day will allow all ENA employees to return to the  office on January 4th with confidence in our ability to continue business as  usual.
I wish each one of you a happy new year.
I continually feel privileged to  work with this dedicated and talented group of  employees.
I look forward to  all that we will accomplish in 2000.
