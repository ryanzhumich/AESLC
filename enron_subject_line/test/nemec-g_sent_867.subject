GT,  How is it going?
Man, was that an ass-whipping or what that we took  from OU.
Looks like we salvaged some dignity with the CU game.
I was planning on coming in for the Missouri game.
I might have my brother  and another friend with me.
How are you set for space.
Those guys could  crash on the couches, if its not a problem with you.
If it is a problem,  just let me know and we can make other arrangements.
Talk at ya later  G
