I sent an e:mail message yesterday saying that I could make dinner in Austin  on Wednesday, October 25.
That date does not work for me now.
I need to  attend a get together for the CommodityLogic team that evening, that was just  set up today.
As of last week, I am now co-leading CommodityLogic (under  Enron Networks) along with Tom Gros.
This is in addition to my role within  ENA.
As a new lead over the group, it is important for me to join the team  for their team building next Wednesday.
Let me know whether or not you have enough takers for dinner in Austin next  week.
If you are short, let me know and I will see what I can do on another  night that week.
