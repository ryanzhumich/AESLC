John Buchanan and I discussed TW's transfer of gas from the PG&E/Topock  receipt/delivery point to the PG&E/Topock Park N' Ride point to implement  TW's use of PG&E's Market Center service.
My understanding is that  physically the points are one and the same, and that the transaction will  simply be a paper transfer.
Since a contract is required in our system as a  formality to implement the transfer, the rate TW will "charge" itself for the  transfer is $0.
This message is to confirm that I see no legal or regulatory problems with  the above scenario.
If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to e-mail or call  me (x30596).
