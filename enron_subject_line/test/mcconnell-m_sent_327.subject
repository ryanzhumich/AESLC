All,  Here is the latest draft.
Please make any changes you want and return.
Paper mark up is best.
Also please leave as a separate word document if you  do it via email  for ease of changing and converting to email late afternoon.
Cathy, please review for your normal grammar and corrections.
I realize that  this is a draft but it will help to have your changes early even though we  will be making additional changes in the afternoon.
Larry, I would like your feedback and commentary as well.
Thanks,
