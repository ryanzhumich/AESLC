We have been working with our Human Resources and Training department to create new learning opportunities for our group.
As a result, we are happy to introduce a professional development program for all of our Senior Administrative Assistants.
In an effort to bring all interested Senior Administrative Assistants the tools necessary to excel in their current positions, a library of learning opportunities has been selected for your use.
Each class was selected with continued performance, improvement, and sustained excellence in mind.
We are very interested in your success as an employee of the EWS Legal Department and  believe this new approach to professional development will allow all  assistants the chance to bring the team to new heights of professionalism and performance.
Listed below are course titles that apply to our group.
Please gain approval from your immediate supervisor and the administrative coordinator before registering for training.
