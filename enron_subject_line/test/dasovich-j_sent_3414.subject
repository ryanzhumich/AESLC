Greetings Catherine and Roger:  A PUC staffer has called our outside lawyer saying that a high school in  Ontario, CA called to complain that we're turning back the school for credit  issues.
The staffer says that "a hospital might also be involved."
Can you  provide any more information?
The PUC staffer does not seem to have much  information, but has nonetheless seems inclined to write us a letter asking  us to explain.
Sort of ironic:  PUC Commissioner Woods states that his goal is to drive all  ESPs from the state, the Legislature passes and the Governor signs a bill  prohibiting Direct Access, and now the PUC is concerned that California might  actually be succeeding in its efforts to kill choice.
(The PUC is  particularly concerned since they recently passed an order prohibiting gas  customers from returning to the LDC---ironic indeed)
