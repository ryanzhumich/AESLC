I've run across what seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter; although it may be  caused by the default settings in a specific trader's blotter.
A few times  over the last several weeks, our traders at the Short Term Southwest desk  have entered off peak deals by choosing the "off" selection under the "Hours"  heading.
But the mask doesn't change to include Sundays and Holidays, and the  traders then enter another deal to compensate for this.
What we've found then  is that the original deal did in fact include a strip for Sundays and  Holidays, round-the-clock hours.
My question is - when you enter an off-peak deal in Deal Blotter, does it  automatically read that as Mon.
through Sat.
off-peak hours AND Sundays and  Holidays round-the-clock?
Even though the mask does not change to show  Sundays and Holidays?
I'm just wondering if there is an easier way to assure  that we've entered off-peak deals correctly other than double-checking them  in Deal Entry.
Please call or e-mail when you get a chance.
Again, this could be just a  matter of incorrect settings in someone's blotter; but I'd like to make sure  either way.
Thanks for your time,
