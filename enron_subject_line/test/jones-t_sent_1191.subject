I understand that you are the Keyspan man!!
We are being asked to look at combined physical/financial guaranty for  Keyspan with the guarantor being KeySpan Corporation d/b/a KeySpan Energy and  the guaranteed parties being KeySpan Ravenswood Inc. and KeySpan Ravenswood  Services.
I have never seen this counterparty as a financial entity before.
We've got Keyspan Energy Management, Inc. as a counterparty we sent a draft  master to about a year ago.
Will these Ravenswood entities trade financial  with us?
Do we need to add Keyspan Energy Management to the guaranty if that  is indeed the Keyspan entity we are trading with?
By the way, what kind of boondoggle trip is this you are on?
You Credit guys  live high on the hog!
You must have a bigger budget than us!
