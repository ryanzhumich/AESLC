As a result of restructuring out-of-the-money transactions with BP Capital  and T. Boon Pickens, we have a total of $9,530,935 in the Schedule C for the  NG Price book.
These values are negative in Schedule C, thus they are  positive value to the book.
A total of $9,321,151 will be released out of Schedule C tonite (8/29/2000).
The remaining $209,784 will be relesed by the end of the week.
We are  awaiting word on whether or not this value will be needed for credit reserve.
Thanks,
