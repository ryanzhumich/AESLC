Carol:  Edward and I spoke with this counterparty on Wednesday (see Lotus  Notes entry).
Edward is pushing this deal for closure next week.
Tanya  knows the credit issues (A2 short term S&P commercial paper rating is  unacceptable so CP has a MAC).
We expect their outside counsel to have some  comments which we haven't yet seen.
Guaranty issues (cap amount, demand  delay).
Nothing has been scheduled formally but I am sure that Edward will  call you for assistance on Tuesday (he is out of town on Monday).
Marie has  the file and is sending CP the 1991 and 1993 definitions.
Our discussion  today was general.
Thanks for your help.
