Today, the Euros are coming and John is going to be running this negotiation - here's the bad news they are not coming until 3:30pm today so we may have to work late.
Barry Tycholiz will be running this team.
Barry - talk to Andy on form if you need help - you will also need to think about getting some traders available over week-end.
The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows:  It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy.
