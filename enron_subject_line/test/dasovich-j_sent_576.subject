Hi:  I was surprised to see you at the I-House last nite.
Haven't seen you  for a while.
Was going to drop by and say hi and catch up but your table was  extremely popular and I didn't want to intrude.
This is the first  travel-free week I've had in a long time.
You want to try to have lunch?
Or  we could meet at a non-I-House place during the break and catch up if you  like.
Dying to hear about Montana and your possible new life as a day  student.
Did you manage to get away last Thursday?
Best,
