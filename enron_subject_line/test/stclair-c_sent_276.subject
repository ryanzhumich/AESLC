David: GPU Energy had the following comments to the ETA:  1.
In Section 2(a) they want Enron to represent that it owns and has the  legal right to grant to Counterparty the use of the Website.
Also, in the  second sentence where we say that they cannot utilize the Website on behalf  of third parties they want to exclude Affiliates.
[Leslie, is this a proper  exclusion given our conversation this week about who will be applying for the  Website password?]
2.
They have deleted Section 4(b) and seem to think that we should provide a  similar indemnity.
I can handle point #2, but what do you think about point #1?
Carol
