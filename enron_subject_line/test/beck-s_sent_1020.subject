Congratulations on the birth of your daughter!
Meagan called this afternoon  to tell me the news.
I will perhaps get more details when I get home  tonight.
I hope that Laura and the baby are doing well.
Let us know what we  can do to help.
I am sure that Jackson is a proud brother.
We will be  anxious to meet our newest neighbor.
