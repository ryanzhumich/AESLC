I couldn't sleep so ive been doing emails, its looking a little better.
And  I didn't get up in the middle of the night and come into the office.
I think  I'll try again and can still get a few hours sleep.
I will be in a little later than I expected, I must drop young Michael off to  school and cant leave there until 8.
See you in the morning.
Sleepy
