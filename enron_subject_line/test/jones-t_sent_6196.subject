Per my discussion with Mark Taylor and our conversation today, attached is  the form of Termination Agreement that should be used when terminating  EnronOnline mistake or "oops" trades.
The trades should continue to be  initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any  unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual  circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk  for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling.
These same  procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions.
Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer  and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company.
The Termination  Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.
The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be  terminated.
Reverse trades should not be entered into.
If you have any questions, please call.
