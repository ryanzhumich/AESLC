Jason (et al):  We are approaching somewhat of a slow-down in active harvesting development, and therefore it is a prime opportunity to begin hashing out what is required to gather the West Power load data you have previously mentioned.
We should get together personally to better organize this initiative, but some things to "prime the pump" are:  1)  What are the requisite sites involved?
(URLs, etc) 2)  What is the frequency of "jobs"?
(how often do we scrape the data; once a day, x number of time a day, etc).
3)  What is the nature of the data we are scraping?
(this will help us to determine if we already have a database schema that this will fit into, or if we need to extend/develop one)  These are just some topics to get us started...you may have already answered some/all of these previously, but I feel they deserve mentioning again, if for no other reason than to make sure we are all on the same page moving forward.
Please reply with your availability over the next few days (as well as anyone else you feel should be involved in this effort), and I will have Amanda schedule a meeting/room for us to get this started.
Thanks,
