Virendra,  Here are the book ids and post ids of the three books that we are having to  manually override each night.
These books are all set up in RiskTrac and are  officialized in Portcalc.
BOOK ID   11/09/00 POST ID  INTRA-NORTHEAST-BAS 941776  INTRA-CNT-GULF-PHY 941701  INTRA-CNT-GULF2-PHY 941767  If you need any more information let me know.
Thanks for your help.
