Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.
During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, "live" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.
The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.
You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day.
If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.
Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.

Market "News" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g.

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation.
