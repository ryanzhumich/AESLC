Great job, as usual, on the United Way kick off today.
I saw Amy Leeand  Eylesse Kalmans as I left the Hyatt and I told them.
Please pass the kudos  along to the rest of your team.
The theme was timely, the staging was great,  the questions on the gameshow were even educational for newer Enron  employees, giving a little histsory and folklore about Enron.
(I knew the  WLEC 1 answer!)
I especially enjoyed the breakfast at Depelchin last Friday.
Their programs  are important to all of us and the tour was very moving as we met some of the  children in the shelter.
