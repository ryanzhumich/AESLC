Following are the deal numbers for interdesk swaps between STCA and STWBom  for Monday and Tuesday.
I'm sorry again for forgetting on Friday.
587941 STCA sells 25 to STWBom 4/23/01 $231.23 PGE3  589743 STCA sells 25 to STWBom 4/24/01 $266.00 NP-15  Let me know if you have questions on these.
I presume Phil talked to you  about why he put the deal in at PGE3 for Monday and NP15 for Tuesday.
Apparently it doesn't have any relevance until FSP is up and running, but it  may affect you guys differently.
Just let us know if it's a problem.
Thanks,
