Just thinking about you and my enron friends.
I finally sold my enron stock last week for $5.25.
PG&E National Energy Group and any other company referenced herein that uses the PG&E name or logo are not the same company as Pacific Gas and Electric Company, the regulated California utility.
Neither PG&E National Energy Group nor these other referenced companies are regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission.
Customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Company do not have to buy products from these companies in order to continue to receive quality regulated services from the utility.
