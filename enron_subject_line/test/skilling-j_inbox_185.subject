Dear Jeff:  I think the meeting went well.
You do realize I had to get a lot of ground work done.
Dave is a smart man and he was very positive.
He indicated to us after you left, he will like to see us work with you to get a few deals moving, realizing the culture of ATT.He will go out of the way to help you and me accomplish what we think is best for the entire industry.
You may want to send him a thank you note, -  draft enclosed.
Feel free to edit it and add your style.
Look forward to working with you.
There are so many thoughts in my mind which one day I will like to download on you - perhaps over dinner.
Please check with Ken how to work out the arrangements with Adventis on the ATT relationship building , Sourcing and the Japan related opportunities.
Talk to you soon.
Regards,
