Brant,  Attached are the Master Firm agreement that Debra prepared based on  your credit worksheet.
I removed the form of Guaranty since we use a  different form for the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.   and I wasn't sure if we  would need a JV guaranty for any of these deals.
Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
