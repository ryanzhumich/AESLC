Guys, in addition please incorporate in each teams package - their Direct  Expense/Headcount ratio to plan average, Productivity ratio to plan average  and team ROCE to plan average and any variances from 2000 to 2001 for  income/expenses taking into account our most latest 2000 forecasts by group.
Wes, I assume that you will be putting together a final 2000 i/s package for  me in the next couple of days.
Thanks
