I'm finally finished with Defensive Driving.
What a complete waste of my  time!!
I passed though.
Can you imagine failing and having to take it  again?!!
I think I'd rather just pay the extra insurance than sit through  that again.
It turns out that I only had about 20 minutes left to watch.
If I'd known that I would have finished it yesterday.
Have you decided what you want to do tonight?
I had a great nap, so I'm up  for whatever you want to do (within reason that is).
Gotta go Canada's calling.
