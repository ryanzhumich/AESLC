Guys, I appreciate the updates.
Please ensure 1) that you, as ENA, are  integrated 2) deliver a very clear expectation with EE&CC with a credible  plan and 3) that you scream bloody murder if a deliverable is missed.
You  will need to bird-dog this to closure on an hourly basis to ensure that we  get over the goal line.
Keep me in the loop daily so that I can keep the pressure on at a senior  level.
Regards
