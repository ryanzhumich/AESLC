Matt,  Can you let me know if the following products are approved for trading for  Singapore counterparties, and what restrictions, if any, they might have  (like the eligible swap participant rules in the U.S.):  Commodity Derivatives (energy commodity, metals) Weather Derivatives Credit Derivatives  Further, would there be any limitation for a Singapore counterparty to trade  any of the products we offer, physical or financial online?
I am going to  attach to this one of our recent excel spreadsheets showing all the products  we trade.
Are there any counterparties that are problematic for derivatives in  Singapore?
For instance, here in the U.S., we flag governmental entities for  no trading until we have a master in place, or upfront due diligence required  before we can approve mutual funds or hedge funds, etc.
Thanks!
