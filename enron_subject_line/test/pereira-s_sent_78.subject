Dave-  There are several little features that EOL traders such as myself would like  to see on the website and stack manager.
I realize that there may be bigger  issues being worked on currently, but would it be possible for EOL to survey  Enron traders as well as outside traders on suggestions for enhancements??
For example, I'd like to be able to sort completed trades by date on stack  manager.
Also, it would be nice if we could have a shading feature on the  website, so people could shade products different colors.
This might cut  down on trades made in error.
Thanks,
