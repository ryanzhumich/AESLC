A meeting has been scheduled on 3/16 with the California Fish and Game to  discuss the following issues:  1)presentaiton of the 1999 and 2000 annual  reports which are required by the facility's 2081 permit.
2) developing an  agreement with F&G as to how the 41 acre credits held by EOTT will be managed  to ensure compliance with requirements of the F&G.
3) Presentation of the  results relating to surveys conducted in the path of construction for the  Rogas project.
The waiver to lay pipeline above ground for the Rogas constsruction was  approved by the Offfice of the State Fire Marshall, Pipeline Safety  Division.
There were 8 city, county, state and federal agencies notified by  application for approval to construct the 9 mile pipline system consisting of  3 piplines.
This is the only agency approval received as yet.
Acre credits were obtained from Aera for the construction of the Rogas  pipeline.
Aera is an oil company with major holdings of acreage available  for purchase.
It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiating  this project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F&G that  EOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessary  acreage for the Rogas project.
This is a major plus for the project.
The rough draft of the baseline noise survey for the turbine installations in  Az.
was received.
Some changes will be made in each document.,  as the  contractor has made some obvious conclusions and asumptions which are not  valid or representative of the mitigation Transwetern will do.
The Navajo  Nation has requested that an onsite survey be conducted at the C/S on the  reservation (C/S 3 and 4)  for T&E plants and animals and archeology.
A  contractor has been notified and surveys will be completed by 3/12.
The F-1  environmental report  for the FERC application will be submitted to Donna by  this friday.
The air permit applications for C/S 1 and 2 have been started.
A meeting  with EPA in San Francisco has abeen set to discuss permitting the C/S  facilities on the reservation on 3/20.
After the meeting, applications  should be in front of the Navajo air permitting agency and the EPA within a  week.
Air permits are expected  within 5-7 months after submittal of the  application.
During a conference call this week, a proposal was submitted to  remove the existing auxillary generators and replace with 2 units at each  location.
This will delay submittal of the air applications 3-4 days,  assuming no major issues result.
One interesting issue that might develop is  that one of the generators might possibly be a wind turbine.
