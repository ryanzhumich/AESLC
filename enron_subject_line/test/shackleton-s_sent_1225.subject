Marie:  Per my voice mail, please let me know when you will have your memo  regarding brokerage agreements and the updated list available.
I would like  to include Susan Flynn, Sheila Glover and Laurel Adams in a meeting since  they are all involved in the brokerage agreement process from time to time.
I'll try to gather the group if you provide me with some suggested times.
Thanks.
Sara
