John:  I don't know if you've been in touch with Instinet but they are now  holding up the documents.
Instinet could not find the ECT Investments, Inc.  executed 1997 agreements (which I have resent to them) and I now have their  lawyer agreed to amend that agreement to add the London terminal.
This should be a minor item.
Can you put pressure on New York?
