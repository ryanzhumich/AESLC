I wanted to review where I think we are in this transaction.
1.
Escrow account.
We are still awaiting  closure on the issue of the  lender's security interest in the escrow account.
A proposal was discussed  with them to ensure that we could still close the transaction even if Delta  had defaulted under their loan arrangement.
Indications were that this  approach was generally acceptable, and Delta/Hancock are to send a letter  agreement concerning this approach.
This has not yet been received.
This  prevents the establishment of the escrow account.
We have sent the escrow  agreement to the bank, but Delta has not completely signed off on the  agreement.
2.
GE turbine contract.
Delta sent requested changes yesterday, and these  were forwarded to GE.
I have not received a response from GE.
3.
Miscellaneous docs.
Enron has responded to all the documents requested  by Hancock.
We are awaiting responses to our drafts.
4.
GE consent.
Hancock requested some changes to the current draft, and a  new letter agreement.
GE hasn't responded to the requests yet.
GE has dealt  directly with Freshfields, so it is possible that there are discussions we  aren't involved in.
I've left Lee a message concernig the GE items and the timing of signing.
Carolyn, please correct/add anything you think is important.
