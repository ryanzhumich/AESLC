Checking your mail, a Confidentiality  Agreement came in from Greg Bruch, I  gave him a call to see what his timing was, he said ite wasn't urgent, but if  we could get an attorney looking at it, to get it final maybe next week.
It  is counterparty's form, they would be the disclosing party, for a potential  fiber source deal.
I am going to pass the agreement on to Carol for review,  and will leave you a copy.
