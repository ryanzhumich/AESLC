Ty and Phil, can you please advise as to the status and provide me copies of all documents related to payment # 1 and # 2 regarding the kern shippers.
What I really want to do is tie out paper work, signatures and ensure that we are tight on all fronts.
Pls advise ( by co. name ) the status of all pending documents and a plan to get signatures as required.
BT
