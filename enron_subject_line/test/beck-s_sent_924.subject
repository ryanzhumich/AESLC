On January 12, I hosted a brainstorming session at the Four Seasons hotel i= n=20 downtown Houston in which we assembled a number of ideas regarding mid and= =20 back office services we could offer to the commodity industry.
To complete=  a=20 plan for launching this strategic commercial venture, we are hosting an=20 integrated design session facilitated by Cap Gemini Ernst & Young (CGEY) at= =20 their Accelerated Solutions Environment in Dallas, Texas.
=20  I am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this desig= n=20 session.
This is a critical two-day event to be held February 12th and 13t= h=20 in Dallas, Texas.
This work session is based on a unique approach called = a=20 DesignShop=01v.
It is a very focused, activity-driven event that is compos= ed of=20 various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups.
If you= =20 have not attended one of the DesignShops related to SAP, you will likely=20 regard this session as different from any working session you have previous= ly=20 experienced.
The prior DesignShops held in conjunction with SAP have proven= =20 to be very successful.
Therefore, we have elected to utilize this same=20 methodology on this very critical and strategic venture.
A limited number of representatives from Enron will be attending.
You were= =20 selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in th= e=20 DesignShop.
You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as= =20 little distraction or interruption as possible.
The quality of our results= =20 depends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the= =20 entire event.
Additionally, you will be relied on in the future to suppor= t=20 and communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session.
= =20 This date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods s= o=20 that your participation can be maximized.
Therefore, please make all=20 necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during= =20 these two days.
