Okay!
Real Time has finally drilled down on the problem we were having with  deal 564094 (STCA buys from EES/HE 9-22 @ $160) and corrected the Real Time  sheet to reflect our price.
I apologize for the delay in finding the source  of the problem, and as it turns out it was just a matter of someone putting  the wrong price in the sheet they sent you.
Very frustrating, I know, but  I've attached the correct sheet nonetheless.
Please call or e-mail with  questions, and I'm sure I'll hear from you soon!
Thanks,
