O.K.
Just wanted to see if we're still on for Saturday night.
Let me know  if anyone else wants to come because I think I'm just going to order the  tickets today over the phone or on the internet.
Also, I was trying to  remember how much I covered of your meal the other night at Sabroso's.
I  think it was around $15, so if it's okay with you I'll just pay for your  ticket and then take the difference from the amount you sent in that email  and cut you a check for that amount (I know I'm very delinquent).
I promise  I'm good for the money.
Also, was wondering if you're still interested in  the Bruce Cockburn concert on the 11th.
Just let me know.
Hope your having  a wonderful day.
