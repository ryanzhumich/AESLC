Sam- Here is a little something about my grandfather:   Dr Walter Herschel Burgess was a 1950 graduate of Alabama Polytechnic  Institute, now Auburn University.
He practied vetinary medicine for 38 years  in Haleyville, Alabama.
Dr. Burgess was blessed with 3 children, 2  grandchildren and one great grandchild.
Dr. Burgess was an avid golfer and  tremendous football fan.
He held Auburn football season tickets for 50  years.
Dr. Burgess recently received the golden eagle from Auburn University  in recognition of 50 years of alumni service.
Dr Burgess was a World War II  veteran.
Dr. Burgess loved Auburn and sent all three of his children and  both grandchildren to school on the plains.
Due to his love for Auburn that  he instilled in his family, there will definitely be a forth generation  Auburn graduate in the Burgess family.
Dr. Burgess was also a proud member  of the OTS vetinary fraternity at Auburn University.
Dr. Burgess was born in  Cullman County, Alabama and was a 50 year resident of Haleyville, Alabama.
Please feel free to take some liberties and rearrange or omit some of the  things I stated above.
Thanks again Sam for all of your help with this and  the recognition this newsletter will give my grandfather.
Auburn is very  fortunate to have such a great person raising money for the most important  school within the University.
Talk to you soon.
