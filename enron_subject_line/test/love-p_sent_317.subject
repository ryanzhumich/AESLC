Attached are the spreadsheets you requested.
The first tab - 100 is the same  sheet as the one we discussed earlier.
The second tab 60.40 is the sheet  that assumes Tom only gets 40% and Sharpe gets the asset deals.
The third  tab is the revised summary sheet for all months if the 60.40 split is the  route we choose to go.
Please feel free to give me a call with any  questions.
Thanks.
