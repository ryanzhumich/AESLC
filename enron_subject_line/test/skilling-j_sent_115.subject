Ladies and Gentlemen,  Thank you all for participating on the associate and analyst PRC committee.
I believe that the PRC process is the most important tool we have to evaluate  Enron's talent, and your role in the process is critical.
With the all  important year-end PRC quickly approaching, I'd like to spend a little time  with you sharing not only my philosophy on the process, but also talking  about the mechanics of the process.
There will also be time to answer any  questions you may have.
To that end, please join me and Charlene Jackson for breakfast on Thursday,  November 30, at 8:30 a.m. in EB50M.
If you are unable to attend in person  and would like to participate by conference call, that can be arranged.
Please RSVP your attendance to Cheryl Kuehl at x3-9804.
I look forward to seeing you on November 30, and again, many thanks for
