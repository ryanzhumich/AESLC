Hello Sukran and Mark;      Welcome back to Turkey.
I hope the weath weather is better in Turkey than here as it has been cold for spring.
Temps in the 50's during the day and while we have had some sunny days there has been plenty of rain.
I have been busy with my Golden "K" Club (Senior Citizen Kiwanis).
We help with a picnic for mentally retarded children, read to needy preschool children, help at mentally retarded track meet, go to weekly meetings and etc.
I am told May is the busiest month and it has been but it is almost finished.
Mother and I have been watching the weather in Italy and imagining what the two of you are doing.
Sue is back and catching up on their business.
This week besides Foundry work they have Visited an honorary dinner for one of Jeff's college professors.
They are also doing some major work  on their house.
The Sweeps are over at WGN-TV for a while so now Tom is looking forward to his trip to Alaska a week from Thursday.
Jeff is still busy with the gas problems so we hear little from him.
I hear Peter Widman is getting married.
Though nothing definite I hear it will be in the fall.
Nothing else for now.
Let us hear from you.
In the meantime  WE SEND BOTH OF YOU  LOTS of LOVE and KISSES    MOTHER and DAD
