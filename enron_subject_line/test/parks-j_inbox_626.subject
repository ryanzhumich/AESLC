Today we discovered that ENA has 310,000 MMBtu parked with The Consumers' Gas Company Ltd. (an affiliate of Enbridge Inc.) at Dawn that needs to be withdrawn by March 31, 2002.
Dan White (403-508-3184) at Enbridge faxed me their confirmation.
According to Dan, this gas was parked in May and June 2001.
Per Enbridge's confirmation, "Customer shall pay Enbridge a fee of $.22 US/MMBtu...prorated over 12 months".
The confirmation makes it clear that March withdrawals are interruptible.
Dan didn't know if ENA has paid the fee but he is letting ENA take this gas for March!!!
So far have not been able to find a deal ticket in Sitara or tagg that   Tomorrow, I will get bids from some of the companies ENA has done business with in the past at Dawn.
Before I sell the gas, I will  	1.  verify the creditworthiness of the company we are selling to 	2.  make sure the company we are selling to agrees to pay us for the gas and doesn't net this with some other item.
Kay, the point we are selling the gas at is Dawn which is in Canada.
Are there any special tax issues to address?
Any comments or questions?
