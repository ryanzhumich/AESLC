Just got a call from a fellow named Jame Edgerly at the Enterprise Zone,  Inc.
He told me that Ken Lay (through Ken's secretary Vanessa) referred me  to him.
He is very interested in getting us to help him work with the  Legislature to establish an "Enterprise Zone" energy tariff to encourage  investment in California's Enterprice Zones.
Before I launch on the effort,  just wanted to check in and see if this rings a bell with you.
Thanks.
Best,
