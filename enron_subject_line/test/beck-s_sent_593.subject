FYI - I had included Diane Seib and Melinda Whalen (from Calgary) in my  promotion memo from Energy Operations.
I believe that they both work under  Peggy Hedstrom in operational roles.
I am sure that they didn't mind having  their names included twice in promotional memos!
Peggy says that you and Juanita are headed to Calgary next week, and she  wondered if I would be coming.
I will be in South America in what should be  summer there.
I do plan to make a trip to Calgary soon.
In addition to  other things that Peggy and I have to cover, I plan to host a happy hour in  Calgary to honor Peggy's promotion and Diane and Melinda, also.
I hosted a  happy hour in Houston for Energy Operations employees who were promoted last  week, and I wanted to do the same thing for the three in Calgary.
