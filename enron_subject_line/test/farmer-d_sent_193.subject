B,   I have had the following problems with the recruiting process recently:  1)  After leaving Toni a message stating that I wanted to offer a postion to  Liz Bellamy, additional interviews were being set up for other groups to  interview her.
Liz had shown up on Dave Baumbach's schedule 2 or 3 times,  even after his manager, Steve Venturatos, interviewed her for me.
Pat Clynes  fond that this was happening while I was out of the office and immediately  called Toni to get it straightened out.
Toni called me at home, which is  good, but whe was not logged into the system, so she was not prepared to  discuss information with me.
2)  At first, Toni was not very responsive to colls/voice mails.
This has  improved over the last week.
She has called me a couple of times awaiting my  decision on salary concerns.
So, I think that she is trying to stay on top  of this now.
Otherwise, I have had limited intreraciton with recruiting.
