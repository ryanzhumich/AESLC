We are trying to revise the draft transaction confirmation per Sean's e-mail  of date.
The original confirm was prepared for "Catalytica, Inc." and the  credit included an additional event of default (cross-default) with  thresholds of $10 million for Catalytica and $50 million for Enron North  America.
Sean has requested that "Catalytica, Inc." be REPLACED with the sub  "Catalytica Combustion Systems".
Should the credit remain the same?
We are withholding release of this confirm pending a response from  underwriting.
Thanks.
Sara
