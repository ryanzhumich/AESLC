I am recommending Linda Robertson (currently Assistant Secretary for the  Department of the Treasury) for the position Vice President and General  Manager of Federal Government Affairs.
Linda would head our Washington, D.C.  office, replacing Joe Hillings who will be retiring early next year.
Linda has interviewed with Ken Lay, Tom White, Mike McConnell and Jeff  Shankman, who join me in this recommendation.
Attached are biographical information on Linda and a National Journal  article identifying Linda among the "Washington 100".
We have conducted extensive reference checks on Linda.
Included among those  was Secretary Summers who said:  "Nobody I know has the determination she has to get objectives met."
"Far more capacity to grasp the details than anyone I've seen."
On Monday, I will seek Executive Committee approval to extend the offer to  Linda.
