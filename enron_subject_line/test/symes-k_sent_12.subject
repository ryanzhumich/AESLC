For some reason, the time management function on eHRonline won't allow me to  log in.
It says the user is locked and to please notify the person  responsible.
I'm using the user ID and password you gave me, so I don't know  what I'm doing wrong.
This is not an urgent matter - just respond whenever  you have time.
