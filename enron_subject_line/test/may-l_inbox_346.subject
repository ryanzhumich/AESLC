(Reuters) - A radio broadcaster known as "Dave the Dwarf" has s= ued to overturn Florida's ban on "dwarf tossing," saying he should be allow= ed to decide for himself whether to participate in the barroom contests.
"= Dwarf tossing" is a contest in which dwarfs don harnesses and allow bar pat= rons to hurl them through the air onto mattresses.

Bars that allow the contests can be stripped of their liquor = licenses.
David Flood, a dwarf who is 38 inches (96.5 cm) tall, filed suit=  on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Tampa, challenging the ban as uncon= stitutional.
He said it illegally singles out people with dwarfism.
"As so= on as you have a physical handicap ... all of the sudden they treat you lik= e you don't have a mind of your own," Flood told the Tampa Tribune.
"Just b= ecause I'm 3-foot-2 doesn't mean I can't make decisions."
Flood, 37, works=  as "Dave the Dwarf" on the morning radio show on Tampa station WFLZ.
