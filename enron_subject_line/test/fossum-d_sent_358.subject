Steve filled in the detail for me on the LG&E issue mentioned in the Law  bullets this morning.
A valve was left open between an LG&E facility and  Northern for an approximate 3 month period (I'm not sure how recent).
LG&E's  gas loss data indicates that the amount of gas that inadvertently got into  Northern was approx.
180,000 MMBtu, with a value of about $500,000.
Rockey  and Steve have talked to LG&E and it does not appear that we have any good  arguments for avoiding the liability.
The unexpected (and unmetered)  deliveries from LG&E presumably reduced our lost and unaccounted for balance  during the referenced 3 month period.
Accordingly, I assume the cost of  replacing that gas should be accounted for in Northern's PRA and so should  not affect earnings.
I'm not sure what the timetable is for resolving this  matter.
