I want to remind everyone when NNG calls on the Carlton Resolution, we can NOT 	allow ANY deliveries at Carlton.
At each cycle, please be sure you monitor any deliveries at Carlton 	and let Steve, Gary or Darrell know if you see any nominations.
At that 	point Carlton Deliveries should be allocated to zero (0).
If you have any questions, or we need to discuss further, please let me know.
Thanks.
Lynn
