Our risk manager has reviewed the insurance requirements.
His only comment  concerned the Owner's/Contractor's Protective Liability Insurace requirement  on the bottom of the first page of Exhibit E.  He thinks this is unnecessary  as we have adequate coverage under the General Liability and Excess Umbrella  Liability.
Since this cost is likely to be passed on to us, we should waive  this insurance requirement.
Everything else is OK from our perspective.
Let me know if you need any  further information or have any questions.
