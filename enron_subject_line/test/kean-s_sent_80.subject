Do we have someone who works for us now who was at Transredes when the  government owned it and could help us do a comparison between our respective  environmental records?
It seems to me that even though we are having our  share of problems, we have probably had fewer problems than the government  did and have probably been more responsive and thorough in our clean up  efforts.
Obviously, we would need to be judicious about how we used such  information (we don't want to aggravate the government), but having such an  analysis may be helpful in showing the progress made and in discouraging  overly punitive action by the government.
What do you think?
