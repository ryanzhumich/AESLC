Attached is a short outline of the proposed steps to transfer the Compressor  Motors, NTUA Contract, and TW Contracts to ECS LLC.
I know we still don't  have structure approval, but I can begin working on the documentation for  those items that will not likely change (the transfer of assets and  contracts).
Please review and let me know of any issues or problems.
