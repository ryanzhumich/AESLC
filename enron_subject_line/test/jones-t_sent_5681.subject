Things may come in a little differently because of Profile Manager (my direct  input into the EOL System).
I will now only see amendments to counterparties  that have already been approved, thru Profile Manager, they will not be  coming in thru the spreadsheets any more.
So, on amendments that affect  power, I am going to have to send you an email about the change.
For the above counterparty, we originally had them open for power sales  only.
Now, Credit is coming back thru wanting to open them up for the bid  and the offer.
Do you want to change the earlier approval from power sales  only, or open them up all the way?
