Guys, good job with the California issues - we didn't get everything but we  managed the position in a very effective manner.
Jim, given our view to support the growth of the ISO structures as a  necessary evil and given the socio-political leaning of these entities,  should we be more actively or aggressively supporting or nominating directors  on these boards?
Jim/Rick, we need a full court press on this NEPool ICAP issue - Allegretti  is putting plan in place.
Regards
