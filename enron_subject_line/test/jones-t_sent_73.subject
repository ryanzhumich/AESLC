As a follow-up to our conversation in London when you said I should bring to  your attention any concerns I might have with financial trading issues, the  following has recently come up as an issue here in Houston (and does so from  time to time).
We will, in fact, be discussing it at our group meeting next  week.
I spoke to Edmund about it when I was there in London, but in light  of the recent Canadian form problems and the resulting concerns of Mark  Haedicke with the integrity of our forms, I thought I should bring this your  attention.
One of our continuing concerns on the financial trading side is that every  financial trading lawyer/paralegal work from the centrally approved forms.
The Houston forms are currently located in a "read-only" directory.
We need  to be careful that users copy the forms out of the directory each time they  use the form.
Copying the form into a personal directory for ease of use  creates issues with people working from outdated base forms, or having forms  evolve without  approval.
Another way forms get changed without going through the approval process is  when an attorney tells the paralegals to make a change in every swap  agreement they approve.
It counts as a form change, not a negotiation  change, if you make it in every agreement.
Ultimately our goal is to centralize the forms in a database easily  accessible to all of us on a global basis (this is a central and critical  component of the Fishkin Project).
Thanks for your attention to this.
