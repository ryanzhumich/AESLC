Lee,  Here is the Agave I/C agreement.
I made a few changes.
Please review:  Para 1:  Agave....a New Mexico corporation...
Article 2.1:  term of ...five (5) years Article 3.3:  New paragraph.
Please wordsmith as necessary.
Also, notice the weird indentation on 3.1 and 3.2.
Can you help this?
Article 8.5:  filled in detail on Agave contacts as per their request.
Let me know.
Thanks, Kim.
