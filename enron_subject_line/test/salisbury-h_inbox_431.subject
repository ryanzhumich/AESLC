BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  Enron Global Markets Enron Global Markets is again teaming up with The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. trade association to organize its second educational seminar on risk management for the industry.
It will be held from 8:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 15, at Plastics Encounter in Atlanta, Georgia International Convention Center.
Enron's risk management services provide plastics processors with customized financial products to help them manage their raw material and energy costs.
Risk management products can protect processors from extreme price movements, minimizing earnings volatility and facilitating cash flow predictability.
They also enable processors to increase pricing flexibility for their customers.
Plastics Encounter Atlanta, formerly known as Plastics Fair, is a plastics industry trade show with a strong conference component and unique networking opportunities.
EGM will have a booth at Plastics Encounter.
Enron Global Liquids Enron Global Liquids will begin trading physical polypropylene and polyethylene plastics.
This marks a huge step forward toward bringing a complete portfolio of solutions to this vibrant, cyclical, ubiquitous, 200 billion pound, industry.
This is a great example of how EGL can apply the extremely successful Enron model (with physical, price risk management, and financing elements) to its commodity markets.
The company will trade all commodity grades of polypropylene and polyethylene, the products used to manufacture such everyday items as packaging, grocery sacks, car bumpers, gas tanks, berber carpet, shampoo bottles, and bread bags among thousands of other items.
IN THE NEWS UK: ANALYSIS-LME members survey hard choices ahead.
By Martin Hayes; 10/18/2001 from Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.
LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange (LME) faces stormy times a year after demutualisation as members ask where their future lies - with electronic screens, on an open-outcry trading floor or even in some other type of business.
The debate is happening as the global metals industry gathers in London for the LME's annual dinner week, which this year will be a subdued affair.
"LME week will struggle to surprise against a backcloth of military action in Afghanistan, dismal economic data, forlorn price sentiment and optimists rarer than hen's teeth," analyst Nick Moore of J.P. Morgan Securities said.
A veteran trader said, "It is going to be a less-populous affair this year.
The people that have to do their annual deals will still be there, but we have noticed that people are not traveling unless they have to."
The downturn in the economic cycle has hit the world's largest non-ferrous metals market hard.
Years of volume growth have ended, prices have fallen to lows and shrinking revenues and commissions have pared many brokers' profits.
MitsuiBussan has scaled back activities and no longer makes markets, ScotiaMocatta has left the floor and blue-blooded N.M. Rothschild has simply quit the non-ferrous metals business.
LME trading remains dominated by the price discovery mechanism of the open-outcry official rings, but electronic systems have made deep inroads over the past year.
"The trade is rapidly being condensed into the three screen mediums.
Enron, Spectron and LME Select," a director at one broker said.
