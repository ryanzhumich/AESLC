Yan,  Based on my review conducted the morning of February 6th, here is a list of  items that need to be addressed in the next version of the West Desk's Flow  Summary sheet:  PGT - These numbers appear to be one day off.
The numbers in the Test Sheet  for February 6th are identical to those used by the West Desk yesterday for  February 5th.
I verified that they are the Cycle 2 numbers posted on PGT's  website for the 5th.
Generally, we use the Cycle 2 numbers, however,  sometimes only Cycle one is available for our morning meeting.
Northwest - None of these numbers match our flow sheet.
It appears the Test  Sheet pulls Cycle 3 nominations, whereas we use Cycle 6.
However, the  website we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until as  late as 7 am (we are not sure why).
I understand you may pull the numbers  from a different place, so we should find out whether you can get the numbers  earlier.
TW - TW numbers appear to be correct, except for the IB Link number.
We pull  the IB link number from the El Paso Blanco I/C point reported by TW.
It  looks like your sheet pulls the number from the El Paso INWPLBLA point.
They  differ by about 5,000, but I don't know if one is more correct than the  other.
To be consistent, though, we should probably change the Test Sheet.
PGE - The numbers also appear to be one day off.
The numbers for February  6th are identical to our Feb. 5th numbers.
Is this a reporting or a  scrubbing problem?
It is possible you are pulling the data from the website  before they update it with the next day's data.
We manually type these  numbers in.
If you pull from our spreadsheet, then the latest numbers would  not be in when this report is run.
El Paso - Most of the numbers appear to be correct, except for the plant  receipts.
The numbers are close, but we should compare our formulas because  I don't think this is a cycle problem.
General - The "Difference" column of the Test Sheet compares the latest cycle  for the current with the final cycle of the previous day.
This can cause  intraday fluxuations in scheduled quantities to appear as day to day  fluxuations.
Any "Difference" column should compare identical cycles.
I  suggest that we add additional cycles to the Test Sheet for the current day  and the previous day.
This way we can compare identical cycles as well as  pick up any intraday fluxuations.
As we discussed, you'll let me know when you're ready to revise this report.
These notes should give us a great place to start.
I look forward to getting  this report ready to use.
