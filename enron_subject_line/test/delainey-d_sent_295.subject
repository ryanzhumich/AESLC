Guys, I would like to add the following commentary to the DASH which will  better reflect my thinking around this investment.
The current text suggests  that there is significant strategic advantage for ENA to be a participant in  the fund.
I do not think that is the case; however, I do see some merits in  the investment based on the needs of Enron's Global Finance group.
I would  suggest toning down the strategic advantages and add the following:   It is unlikely that given the funds target returns that the it will be an  effective permanent monetization vehicle for ENA's strategic and merchant    investments; however, Enron Global Finance believes that the investment is  important for the following reasons:   a) provides an additional "Friend of Enron" to facilitate short to medium  term balance sheet and regulatory solution to highly structured    commodity  and capital transactions in the wholesale group;   b) provides alternative sources of short term capital liquidity and   c) by further developing the relationship with AIG provides collateral  benefits for Enron's overall Global Finance capability and business.
ENA would have a requirement that this investments be hedged through Raptor  and be managed by the Enron Global Finance Group.
