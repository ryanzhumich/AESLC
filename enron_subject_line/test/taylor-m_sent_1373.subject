As the office construction process continues, your offices will be among the  next to be demolished & reconstructed.
While the current timetable is not  firm, it looks like your moves will be scheduled sometime between the 5th to  the 13th of October (this means the move may take place during the ENA  offsite).
I just wanted to give you as much warning as possible so you could  begin the packing process.
Joya Davis will have details of your new (in some  cases temporary) office locations, can help with obtaining boxes and will  schedule the actual move.
