You may notice that 9911 PMA's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final  P&L.
You will also notice that the detail following the majority of the  adjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.
At the close of business for the 991  P&L, we saw a gain of approx.
$250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.
We  thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to  offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.
Therefore,  the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L.
I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&L for the month of  November.
