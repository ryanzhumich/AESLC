Kern River Expansion Bid - Executed approximately 6 agreements with  producers to partcipate in Kern River's Open Season.
Producers were required  to bid in Open Season and upon award of capacity by Kern, the producers will  assign such capacity to ENA in exchange for 25% of ENA mark to market profit  on the capacity.
Overall objective of the project was to increase ENA  capacity stake on this expansion.
The basis is currently very profitable  between Wyoming and California.
Worked with Barry Tycholiz and Mark Whitt  2.
