Dave:  I was talking with my brother-in-law who is Kinder/Morgan's VP of Corp  Development and they would be interested in talking with us about  contributing their 5,000 MW's of generation into a JV/Partnership to lead  into a public offering.
We are still under several different CA's with them,  due to our past conversation's regarding generation.
With our previous discussions, Rich Kinder had suggested to Kevin Hannon if  Enron would be interested in buying the whole Orion  Project, but at that  time ENA was only interested in the first couple of projects, due to the  delivery of the turbines.
In light of our past discussions and KMI's desire to exit the generation  business, this JV would give them the perfect "exit strategy".
Also, it  would give us a better growth strategy, with respects to our talks with other  parties.
I know that bringing in a potential third party would complicate  the deal structure, but I think that it would build a much better growth  story to Wall Street.
If you think this would be a good idea, I can begin to set up a meeting as  soon as possible with Kinder/Morgan.
Thanks!
Ben
