my printer just froze, and I want to look at the doc to finish the  reorganization.
Could you pretty please fax me the first 14 pages (I have  the last).
Also, could you look at the stuff I've highlighted in yellow.
I haven't put all your comments in, but I will in a minute.
Don't get  discouraged, the draft is closer to finished than it looks, it is just the  changes are in my head.
It won't take too terribly long now.
I've set up the exhibits as a separate document to make it easier to move  around the doc.
I think it would be kind of strange to send a draft without the most basic of  commercial terms included.
Stranger things have happened of course!
Many thanks.
Kay
