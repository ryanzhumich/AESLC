Further to our discussions yesterday, attached is a draft letter agreement = under which Transwestern would agree to terminate the Mavrix transportation=  contracts.
Note that Mavrix is required to indemnify TW for any revenue s= hortfall if the turned back capacity is not purchased by another customer a= t the same or better rate within 60 days.
I believe this approach allows T= W to accomodate Mavrix's request to terminate without TW taking any financi= al risk or exposing itself to requests from other shippers that TW release = them from their contract obligations without penalty.
=20  Upon execution of the letter agreement, the capacity will be posted on the = TW bulletin board as generally available capacity.
There is some chance th= at a customer interested in the capacity will want to know where it came fr= om.
I would suggest that the appropriate and accurate explanation is that =  "capacity becomes available from time to time for a variety of reasons inc= luding contract expirations or terminations, waivers or expirations of ROFR=  rights, and contract MDQ stepdowns.
Such capacity is posted on the EBB as=  soon as Transwestern becomes aware of its availabity."
If the questioning=  customer wants to know who's space it was, I believe it is our consistent = policy to not disclose any information about any shipper's contract to any = other shipper and that policy should be followed here as well.
Of course, = if the Commission's Market Monitoring group or other FERC personnel call, t= he confidentiality problem does not arise and the shipper's identity should=  be disclosed.
The explanation in that circumstance, if the caller wants m= ore detail, is that "Mavrix is an Enron affiliate that was in the business = of trading interstate pipeline capacity but is winding down its business an= d terminating its contracts.
Transwestern has agreed to contract terminati= on subject to an indemnity or "keep whole" mechanism.
"=20  I'm including the legal team on this distribution as an FYI.
I will follow=  up on this later today.
