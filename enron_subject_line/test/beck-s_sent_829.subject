An update on two of the items that we discussed before you went out of town:  Due Diligence Teams for Acquisitions Identified  I have worked with my operations controllers in EWS and have identified a  short list of individuals that we could use in the due diligence efforts on  potential acquisitions.
We have identified our target teams for due  diligence efforts around commodities.
While each person on the list has  other duties currently, all have back ups that would allow them to be devoted  to projects as they arise.
I will review this list continually and update it  as I identify other qualified operations personnel who could do an excellent  job as part of a due diligence team.
I mentioned that Kristin Albrecht had  created a due diligence check list while she was in London on the MG  acquisition.
We will hold a session in the next 10 days to review this  checklist so that all are prepared.
Let me know if you are interested in the  names on my list.
Also let me know if there is a pending due diligence  effort.
Dedicated Support Named for Transportation Business  I met with Dan Reck and Chris Kravas week before last and have reviewed the  executive summary from the consulting team.
I followed up with Brent Price  (my operations controller for EGM) to review his plan for creating an  appropriate infrastructure to support that business.
Currently, Todd Hall  and Mike Perun on Brent's team are assessing what needs to be done.
Todd has  other responsibilities and Dan Reck was concerned about the amount of time  that Todd would have.
Brent has since recruited Shelley Stubbs to play the  lead role over operations integration for Webmodal.
She will be returning to  Houston from the London office by the end of March.
She will be able to  split her time starting next week to focus on Webmodal.
Todd will stay  involved until Shelley is devoted fulltime at the end of March.
We will also  keep Mike Perun on the assignment working for Shelley.
Shelley is expected  to be in Houston next week, and I will sit in on meetings with her next week  regarding our plans.
I will keep you posted.
