Due to the overwhelming response from Enron employees and contractors, today's blood drive appointments are completely full, and there are a large number of you who still wish to donate blood.
We are working diligently with the M. D. Anderson Blood Bank to schedule another day for blood donations, and you will be notified as soon as that date is secured.
For those of you who are interested in giving, please continue to either call the Enron Health Center, ext.
3-6100, to get your name on the waiting list or go to the donation line in front of the building.
We recognize and are grateful to the many of you who are wanting to give blood today, but ask that you be patient and understand our inability to accept walk-in donations at this time.
Thanks again for the tremendous outpouring of concern.
