In light of numerous construction delays, increased sponsor contributions,  unusual central bank exposures etc.
we would like to conduct a comprehensive  review of our insurance coverages  for the Cuiaba I Project.
I am availble  at your convenience to begin meeting for the exchange of info which will be  required to fulfill this endeavor.
