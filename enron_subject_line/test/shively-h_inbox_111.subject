Hi Hunter, I recently joined the A/A program as a Senior Analyst as of November 2001 on recommendations from Jim Fallon, Paul Racicot, and Nicole La and I would like to speak with you on any opportunities that you may have within the Gas Fundamentals group.
I am currently working for Paul Racicot on the EBS trading desk as a metro capacity trader but I am interested in pursuing other opportunities within Enron.
I am ultimately interested in joining the Gas trading track and believe the fundamentals group would be an excellent place to start.
I've attached a copy of my resume and two recommendation letters one from Nicole La and one Joe Edwards, who heads up the bandwidth capacity trading desk, for you to review.
If you have any questions please call me at x34212.
Jim Fallon, Paul Racicot, Nicole La and Joe Edwards would also be happy to speak with you regarding my performance and potential at Enron.
Thank-you
