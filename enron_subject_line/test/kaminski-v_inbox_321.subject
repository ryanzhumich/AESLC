Dear Mr. Kaminsky,  As a first year MBA student at Rice University I am searching for a summer internship.
Peter Veruki informed me that you were impressed with the Rice ALP students working at Enron and may have further opportunities available for this summer.
Similar to the Enron ALP, I worked on an Action Learning Project with Phillips Petroleum which involved a pension fund analysis along with recommendations delivered to senior management.
Prior to beginning my studies at Rice,  I worked as a programmer with El Paso Energy, working on a proprietary energy trading system I would like to speak with you concerning opportunities at Enron for this summer.
Please call me at your earliest convenience.
I can be reached at home at (281) 480-4894.
I have attached my resume for your consideration.
Thank you,
