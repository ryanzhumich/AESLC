Tom,   Here are the fault paretos of fault counts for all sites for May 2002  (may2002paretos_faults.pdf).
For readability only the top 30 faults for each  site are displayed.
Both Texas sites had VERY high numbers of "wind  deviation" faults.
I am also attaching a file (from a different work request) that has a pareto  (by site) of the mean number of faults per turbine (may2002mean_faults.pdf),  which shows that the Texas sites have the highest mean faults per turbine.
This also has boxplots of the number of faults by site to show the outliers.
I will do the June data, if still desired, when the data upload is completed.
As always, if you have questions or comments let me know.
Mark
