General Whalley,  Kept thinking I would see you around outside to tell you personally how excited I was to hear of your promotion.
Just wanted to take a moment to tell you  how proud I am of you and your accomplishments.
I knew you would do a great job for Enron when Lloyd and I moved you here.
Little did I know How well.
It does my heart good to see someone of your calibre come into a new Corporate environment and progress to such heights.
Belated Congratulations, Deborah Kallus Enron Relocation Consultant
