Michelle Here are my very minor comments.
However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today.
One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios.
Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes?
In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron?
(i.e.
So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e.
California Legislature).
Sheri  When you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious.
Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a "Dateline" type theme for one, and a "60 Minute" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme.
In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e.
title change to manager)?
Cheers Kirk
