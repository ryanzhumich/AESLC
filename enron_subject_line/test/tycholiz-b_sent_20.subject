Fran...
I have received the L1 visa package and will use documents to Enter  the US on Friday morning.
I have also received the bridge loan documents and have signed these forms  and sent them back to as of right now via inter office mail..... you should  have by tommorrow ( Weds).
Can you please sign as required.
I think that is about it other than I need to make arrangements for a cheque  to be in my hands for friday morning.
At this time, I still do not know  where to have this sent.
Thanks.
BT
