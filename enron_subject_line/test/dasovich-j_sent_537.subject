Well, wouldn't you know it.
I couldn't find the most recent version in my  email.
But here's the 10.03 version with a few edits.
Couple of other  points:  I still very much like the idea of taking the table out and includling as an  attachment.
I still think that the table doesn't explicitly address an option Rick may be  thinking about "Maintain presence with fewer resources."
Think it's  something we need to focus on.
Have a great weekend.
Spreadsheet to follow.
