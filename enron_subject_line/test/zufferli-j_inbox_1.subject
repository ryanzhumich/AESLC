Please find attached the latest, and what should be the final for the immediate period of time, copy of the marketing list.
Please filter the PA column by your name to double-check against the list you are currently working off of.
There are some smaller subsids of larger companies previously assigned now listed.
I pulled these subs in from the credit pre-approval list.
I will be passing out draft contracts folders for these counterparties tomorrow to the people responsible for the respective parent companies.
There are some companies on your lists that do not have draft packets.
These companies have NOT been pre-approved by credit, but credit is working on them now.
Continue to call these customers regarding password applications, but do not promise that the ISDA documents, etc.
are immediately forthcoming until we receive those worksheets from credit.
Please continue to pass on both the pa information and the draft packets as you receive the correct contact info.
If you have any questions at all, please call me at 5-3614 or come by my desk at 06541 in the rotunda.
Thank you,
