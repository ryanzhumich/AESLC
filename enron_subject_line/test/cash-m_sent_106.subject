2.
Efficient management of drafting, negotiating, revising, and completing  several types of contracts in numerous different jurisdictions (e.g., almost  200 employment agreements, 35 separation agreements, and 30 consulting  services agreements).
3.
Lead attorney on Project One (which involves issues surrounding the  OFCCP's "glass ceiling" audit of ENA and all of Enron).
4.
Labor and employment transactional support, including:  East Coast Power,  Ecogas, CGas, Project Hurricane, Columbia, Project Grizzly, Las Vegas Cogen,  and other acquisitions that involve the transfer or hiring of personnel.
