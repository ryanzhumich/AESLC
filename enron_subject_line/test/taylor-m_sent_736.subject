We need to revise the Counterparty Matrix procedures.
Counterparties with a  North American financial master agreement should only map to North American  financial products (including all weather and paper transactions).
Therefore, please revise the counterparty matrix to reflect that those  counterparties with a North American master map to GTC's for European  derivative transactions.
Please call me or Tana if you have any questions.
Thanks!
