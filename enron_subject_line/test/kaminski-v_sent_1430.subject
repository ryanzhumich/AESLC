John,  The outline of a message to Nesbitt.
Dale,  Thanks for your message.
In our phone conversation before the meeting  you  mentioned  another contractual arrangement under which we could work with  your  company  employees on a case-study.
The cost of a weekly project  would be $12,000 that would be applied to the  purchase price should we go ahead and decide to acquire the software.
This project would allow us  to evaluate the model and come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support  the model  internally.
Please, let me know more about this option.
Vince
