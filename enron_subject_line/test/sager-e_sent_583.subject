Attached is revised draft that incorporates all of PG&E's earlier comments  and is marked to show my proposed revisions.
Please review and let me know if  you have any comments.
If possible, we should send back to PG&E today.
Several Letters of Credit are soon to expire and we will otherwise need to  provide substitute Letters by the 11th.
As always, thanks for everyone's help.
