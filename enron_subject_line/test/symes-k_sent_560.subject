Finally!
After a slight uphill battle, we've successfully entered the first  three futures deals under the Mid-Columbia NYMEX settlement price.
Because  all of you were involved in this process in one way or another, I thought I'd  let you know that it was successful in the end, and forward the deal numbers  along for reference.
They are as follows:  TAGG Futures Deals - QQ0362 (J-01)                QQ3837 (K-01)                   QQ7050 (M-01)  ENPOWER Swap Deals - 517925 (J-01)        517928 (K-01)        517929 (M-01)  Thank you for all of your patience and cooperation.
If you have any  questions, please let me know.
