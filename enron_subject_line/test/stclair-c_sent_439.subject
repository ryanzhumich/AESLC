Brant: I need your help in answering the following questions:  EL PASO  Is the collateral threshold for both of us $50,000,000?
What are the Guaranty caps?
Is the cross default threshold now for both of us $100,000,000?
Should cross default only apply to the Credit Support Providers or should it  apply to the parties and their credit support providers?
OCCIDENTAL  Should we insist on our "affiliate" setoff language?
