With the change in segmentation rules on Transco, it has become much more  critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we  are buying.
Mr. Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the  points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary.
I would  prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the  delivery points.
I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the  month.
Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt  and delivery point on the contract.
But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it  and I am unable to verify the information myself.
It could have a big impact  on what we flow in Z6.
Colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process?
Let  me know if you need specific capacity examples.
