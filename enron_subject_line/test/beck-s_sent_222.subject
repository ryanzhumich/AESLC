Diana,  Here's info you requested.
Per our conversation earlier, please try to  arrange someone with experience/knowledge of Jornada device for training for  Sally & me both.
Sally is not very technical & will need to be walked thru.
If she doesn't learn how to properly use it, she will not use it, if you know  what I mean.
Any help you can give me in setting up training w/ someone that  will be able to answer our questions is greatly appreciated.
Please have  person contact me directly as I keep Sally's calendar.
She will be in  training all day Thursday & Friday, so Monday would be the soonest she is  available.
