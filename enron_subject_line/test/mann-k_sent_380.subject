I spoke with Kent Shoemaker, and he has a conflict at 930 Houston time  today.
I suggested to him that Enron go forward with the call as an internal  call, and we can conference him in after 1000 (when he's available), if we  have anything noteworthy to report.
If that is acceptable, I will go to Sheila's office at 930, and we can call  Scott and Rose.
How does that sound?
