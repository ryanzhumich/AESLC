It sure sounds like you have your hands full with the restructuring!
I have  been trying to get a better grasp of the deal flow in Brazil through some  type of "Deal Report".
In Houston and Argentina, the business groups  circulate a transaction listing.
Also, legal in both Houston and Argentina  circulate a listing from Legal's perspective.
Is a commercial team deal  report circulated weekly in Brazil, and if so, can I be added to the  circulation?
I will ask Randy if he can circulate his list.
It would be  helpful for me when we have our weekly conference call.
In that regard, what  is "Alcan", the PPA which may eventually serve as a template?
I am glad to  prepare some type of module as Randy suggested which sets forth basic Enron  Corp. and/or trading policy as to certain issues (force majeure, governing  law, dispute resolution, damages, etc.
),  Let's coordinate for the seminar  which you are organizing for March.
Thanks.
Sara
