As a follow-up to my email regarding the execution of the 12/29/00 ISDA  Master Agreement between Deutsche Bank AG and Enron North America Corp.,  please be further advised:  Effective 6/4/99, Bankers Trust Company was acquired by Deutsche Bank AG.
All financial trading should now be transacted under the above Deutsche Bank  ISDA Master Agreement.
No further financial trading should be done in the  name of Bankers Trust Company, and the 4/16/91 ISDA Interest Rate and  Currency Exchange Agreement with Bankers Trust Company should be inactivated.
All outstanding Bankers Trust Company financial trades were assigned to  Deutsche Bank AG in the ISDA Master Agreement, and all the Bankers Trust  Company trades should be moved to Deutsche Bank.
