Per your request, attached is the hedge strip file that we use to calculate  your bench every night.
On one of the tabs R2, you will find your positions  and a conversion factor.
I have tied these to the benchmark groups  conversion factor numbers.
Let me know if we need some of these points  changed, i.e.
CGPR-DAWN's conversion factor is 0.
Shout with any questions.
Thanks.
