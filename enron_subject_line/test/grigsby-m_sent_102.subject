Please make certain that all physical positions are loaded correctly in NCD  for term.
Have Patti Sullivan load all transport from the transport model in  sitara so that the physical index positions will be recognized in NCD.
This  would include SJ/Perm to Socal through OCT, Baja through MAR 20001 (100,000/d  short PG&E Topock, 20,000/d long KRS, and 80,0000/d long Citygate), Kingsgate  to Malin(Barry), Steve South's latest transport deal from Kingsgate/Stanfield  to Malin, and any SJ to Waha transport.
Anne, did you get a ticket from Steve on the transport mentioned above?
King/Stan to Malin.
Also, let me know what the status of the transport deal from Kingsagte to  Malin with Barry.
Is the gd index for Perm position loading correctly in NCD for Apr-Oct?
Mo, please carry out the physical positions in NCD through Mar 2001.
Thanks!
