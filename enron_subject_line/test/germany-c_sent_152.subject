Mary downloaded the purchases and the sales to excel.
I spot checked some of  the deals and they look good to me.
There are 2 small deals that are  missing, deals 480324 and 480325.
These deals are related to the CGLF NYMX  purchase.
I had the buy/sale on CGLF.
I didn't enter the buy/sale on CGAS  until this afternoon.
Alvin should have these tracked and balance early next  week.
The dollar impact should be very small.
Remember, I'm out next week.
