Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:  We received notification that the 6th segment to gate valve 5 providing a total firm capacity of 519 Mdth/day was approved by FERC yesterday and is available for transport.
The contract effective date for this additional capacity will be on Monday, November 5.
We plan on filing the request for the final segment of additional contacted capacity to gate valve 4 today or Monday.
Based on conversations with many of you, it appears the 192 Mdth/day of additional (572 Mdth/day total) capacity on Medicine Bow provided by this last segment commissioning will be sufficient to accomodate your transportation requirements until the entire project goes into service (anticipated late this month).
For the month of October, the capacity contracted was approximatly 90% utilized, and we anticipate even greater utilization for November.
While a few of you have mentioned possibly having production in excess of your contract, it appears that the remaining shippers will have underutilized capacity and no additional capacity will be necessary until the Loop goes in service.
Following the last segment approval notice, I will continue to update you on the progress and timing for the entire Loop in-service for your information and planning.
Please call me if you have any questions.
