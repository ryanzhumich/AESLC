As if  that is not enough numbers 6pm is the time the rehersal begins.
We are on a  very tight schedule so prompt attence is appreciated.
The location is the SE  corner of Kirby and Westheimer.
If you are coming from 59 you turn left on  Kirby (north) and go to Westheimer and turn right (east) and it is on your  right.
Also, the rehersal dinner is following the rehersal at Buca di Beppo  at around 7:30.
We hope you will be able to attend.
