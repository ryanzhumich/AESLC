Morning sunshine..all is well here in London...doing alot of looking around and am totally overwhelmed with the sense of world history with each step taken and each sight seen...looked at 16 flats to try and find a place to live on friday, only one is a real candidate with possibly one other..will know more today on that front...you need to do one thing when you pack for your trip to London.BRING YOUR WALLET.
ive lived in chicago, miami, houston, kansas city, seattle and spent alot of time in both  san fran and las vegas..im here to tell you no TWO of those cities combined are as expensive as London standing alone..its unreal!!!
It seems to me we might have a shot at closing on that friday Nov.2...give me a few more days to get things cleared up and Ill let you know...if your dying to hear my sexy voice u can dial direct just as you read it..011447786844020..it is my new mobile phone..hope all is well..S
