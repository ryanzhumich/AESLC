Debra,  It was a pleasure speaking with you yesterday regarding the GISB contract.
I look forward to receipt of your suggested language for the netting and dispute resolution provisions, and your decision on the acceptability of our Sections 10.3, 10.4, and 15 (Confidentiality).
Please do not hesitate to call if we need to discuss this further.
Unless you instruct otherwise, we intend to sign the Base Contract first, and then FedEx partially executed originals to you for signature.
Thanks,
