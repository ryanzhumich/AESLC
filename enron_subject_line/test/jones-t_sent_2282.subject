Justy,  We are going to be trading with Deutsche Bank out of their New York and  London branch offices online.
Per my conv.
w/the online team, we going to  have to have them come in thru both Houston and London as a counterparty (we  haven't solved multibranch customers online).
With Edmund out, I need  someone to email me your Electronic Trading Agreement and Password  Application so we can send them to the lawyer we are negotiating the ISDA  Master with.
Can you have someone there send me the docs.
Much thanks...
