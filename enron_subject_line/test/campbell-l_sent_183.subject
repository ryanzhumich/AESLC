John, I read Phil's statements concerning the Redrock air permit issue and  would like to shed some additional light concerning the reason why   Transwestern  did not know about the delay in the agencies issance of the air  permits.
I had met with each agency prior to submitting each application to  ensure that each application contained the correct and proper information  required by the EPA and State of Arizona.
When I told them that we were  expecting the permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a  September permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that  energy issues were to be given top priority in the State of Califonia.
I  phoned the  permit engineer assigned to each application monthly to be kept  aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.
In all monthly calls,  both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule.
As we  approached the anticipated September issuance, calls to the agencies were  conducted weekly and this was when I found out about the 1-4 month additional  time which would be required for the permit issuance.
I dont know what else  could have been done to track and alleviate problems encountered to ensure  that the permits would be issued in a timely manner.
