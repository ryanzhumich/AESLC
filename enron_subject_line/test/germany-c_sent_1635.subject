I have 2 storage questions for now.
1.
Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking  facility.
The current balance is 1,500,000 dth.
Did you have a withdrawal  schedule or were you going to use this as peaking gas?
2.
TCO contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 BCF, and I think your current  storage balance is about 5 BCF.
What is your withdrawal schedule for Jan??
thanks
