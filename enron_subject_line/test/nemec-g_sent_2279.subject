Some thoughts that might help from time to time.
This was forwarded to me,  and I found it very compelling.
G   Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one  so  that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful  for that gift.
When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often  times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has   been opened for us.
The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a  porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it  was the best conversation you've ever had.
It's true that we don't know what   we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've   been missing until it arrives.
Giving someone all your love is never an  assurance that they'll love you back!
Don't expect love in return; just wait   for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't, be content it grew in  yours.
It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone,  and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.
Don't  go for looks; they can deceive.
Don't go for wealth; even that fades away.
Go  for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark   day seem bright.
Find the one that makes your heart smile.
There are moments   in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from  your dreams and hug them for real!
Dream what you want to dream; go where  you  want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one  chance to do all the things you want to do.
May you have enough happiness to   make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you  human, enough hope to make you happy.
Always put yourself in others' shoes.
If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too.
The  happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just  make the most of everything that comes along their way.
Happiness lies for  those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have  tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have  touched  their lives.
Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a  tear.
The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you  can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and  heartaches.
When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was  smiling.
Live your life so that when you die, you're the one who is smiling  and everyone around you is crying.
Please send this message to those people  who mean something to you, to those who have touched your life in one way or   another, to those who make you smile when you really need it, to those that  make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down, to those  who you want to let them know that you appreciate their friendship.
And if  you don't, don't worry, nothing bad will happen to you, you will just miss  out on the opportunity to brighten someone's day with this message.
