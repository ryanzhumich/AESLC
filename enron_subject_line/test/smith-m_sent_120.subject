Sara,  Yo, what's up?
How are things across the street?
Let me guess, you got all  rested up saturday and sunday, then when out three nights already this week,  and now are ready to go home, do laundry and sleep.
Unfortunately, I've been  extremely lame, mostly because you got me sick...well maybe not.
Anyway, I  haven't been feeling so hot, yet I did oversleep by two hours this morning  which really helped.
Poor Ted had to pick the slack.
So, any big plans for  the weekend besides laundry?
Superbowl?
Happy hour?
Toilet flushing into  the phone?
Stupid drunk?
