Under the regulations of the state of Arizona, facilities which have a  pollution prevention plan (sta.1, sta.
2 and Needles) are required to have an  annual training to evaluate pollution prevention activiies.
I have scheduled  with the above three facilities to have pollution training on the following  dates:    Kingman team June 21    Flagstaff team June 22  This training is to be completed by July 1 of every year.
This training will  last for approximately 2-3 hours.
Employees that works at any of the three  facilities are required to be present for the training.
Your participation  in this will be greatly appreciated.
