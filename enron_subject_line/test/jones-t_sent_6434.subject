Debbie Brackett and I met this week and reviewed the various Koch Hydrocarbon  Company Divisions and have developed the following game plan to resolve the  division issue with respect to this counterparty:  The following entities exist in GCP:  1.
Koch Hydrocarbon Co. (GCP #36680):  We would like this entity to remain  OPEN and to be renamed "Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch  Hydrocarbon Company Division".
2.
Koch Hydrocarbon Company (GCP #57853):  We would like all future trading  with this entity SUSPENDED.
There appears to be one trade under this entity  and this trade should me moved to GCP 36680.
3.
Koch Hydrocarbons Inc. (GCP #26197):  We would like all future trading  with this entity SUSPENDED.
There appear to be no trades under this entity.
With respect to the current financial trading being done by Koch Industries,  Inc. (GCP #126) (not under a master agreement), I spoke to the Legal  Department at Koch and we will be entering into a side letter agreement with  Koch that will put all financial trades done by Koch Industries, Inc. under  the existing ISDA Master Agreement we have with Koch Industries, Inc. acting  through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.
I will let you all know when  such side letter agreement has been executed.
As soon as GCP #36680 has been renamed we can re-submit them to EnronOnline  and open them up for trading.
