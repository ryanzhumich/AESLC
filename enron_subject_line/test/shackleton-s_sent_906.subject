I received a call from Jay Boudreaux (CTG group working with paper & pulp)  about presenting "agreements" to the lender (Paribas) for review in  connection with the loan for construction of the mill.
I know that Jarrod  has prepared "draft confirms" for these companies but I don't know if anyone  has raised the ISDA issue.
Sounds like too many hands in the pot but the  bank may really need to see Master Swap Agreements.
Let me know if this has  already been addressed.
Thanks.
