Ruth-  I went ahead and scheduled Kali to do the GSWEC camp the first two sessions.
I've only put the deposit down, so I can get that money back if we decide to  do the Blue Fox Farm camp instead.
Hopefully, we'll have that info the first  week in May.
Marla is planning on signing up Blakely for the second session  there, pending what the Blue Fox Farm schedule looks like.
I think Anna  Edelman is also interested.
I left a message with Sue today letting her know  that I was reserving a spot for Kali at GSWEC just in case the Blue Fox Farm  doesn't work.
Thanks,
