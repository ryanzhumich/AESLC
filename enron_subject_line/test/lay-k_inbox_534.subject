Hello everyone,  I am writing to confirm your participation in the RFF Council & Board of Directors meetings on Wednesday, October 10 and Thursday, October 11, respectively.
In light of the events of September 11 and subsequent travel difficulties, we thought we'd double check with our out-of-town Directors on their attendance.
We hope you are still able to join us.
If your plans have changed in any way, please let me know at your earliest convenience.
We look forward to seeing you!
Regards,
