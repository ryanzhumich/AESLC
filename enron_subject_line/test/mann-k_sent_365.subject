Availability:  single computation despite source of power (market or=20 facility).
Is forced outage the correct concept since we want to have some= =20 discretion, and LD structure should apply even if power coming from the=20 market?

LD=01,s should apply regardless of= =20 scheduled source of power =01) no cost of cover for market power.
3.
Our position is that Contract Capacity set at contract signing, then=20 adjusted (if necessary) based on performance tests, not subject to adjustme= nt=20 after that time: ditto for the demand charge.

Is there a benefit to Enron to have a correction curve exhib= it?
