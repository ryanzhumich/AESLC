Rick/Jim  1)  It has come to my attention that the relocation of employees to home countries is in jeopardy.
Third hand, I understand that Prudential has refused to continue to pack, move and pay air fare to people seeking to move due to concern about clawback of payments made by the bankruptcy court.
Many of those literally have no money.
Is there any way to get the facts out to everyone and to address these issues?
These are questions of legitimate expenses addressing basic human needs like food, clothing and shelter.
2) I would suggest that we grab(pay)  in-house counsel here that understands the business (Paul Simons?)
in lieu of paying Weil for what I percieve as little or no value added.
3) As stated in yesterday's meeting, we will need to rely on EEL employees to do things like maintain books, provide settlements/invoices, accounting and banking among others.
They either work for the administrator or have been let go by the administrator.
Some provision to pay them needs to happen quickly.
4) FYI - I spoke with David Messer, the head of Sempra Energy Trading, yesterday.
David had been with Drexel during its bankruptcy.
He said that all retained employees received an immediate 100% increase in pay (on the day of the filing) and did not intimate that such things as economy class airfares to repatriate employees needed to be reviewed by Congress.
I realize that everyone is in some level of chaos, but based on what I read in the press, there are lots of decisions being made where the priorities - legally, morally, and ethically - appear to be in an improper order.
Anything either of you can do to re-order such things would be appreciated.
Ted
