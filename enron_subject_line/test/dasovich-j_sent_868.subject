I've tried to capture in the document Dave sent around on Friday, the  preliminary conclusions/directions we came up with in today's meeting.
If  I've mangled or missed anything, please chime in.
If folks have information  (i.e., bullet points) to discuss at Wednesday's meeting regarding the various  issue areas they're thinking about, please foward along to me by COB tomorrow  and I'll compile for distribution first thing Wednesday morning.
Best,
