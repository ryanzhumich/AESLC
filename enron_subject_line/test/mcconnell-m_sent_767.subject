Attached is the first draft of the eCommerce Commercial and Origination  Activities Contact List.
This is being prepared for a wider distribution,  therefore, please take a moment to review the list carefully and let me know  if you have any changes to the list or if you would like to add any  additional names to the list that you feel are appropriate.
The purpose of  this document is to provide a consistent means for all areas of Enron to  direct questions and inquiries related to specific eCommerce issues.
Thank you.
