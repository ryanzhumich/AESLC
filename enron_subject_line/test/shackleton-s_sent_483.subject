I know that you were in the Rio office during the latter part of last week.
I sent you an e-mail last week to see how you were doing with the  research/memo.
I also called Marcelo Rodrigues and left a message.
I have  not heard from either you or Marcelo and I am anxious to continue our  dialogue.
Please e-mail or call at your earliest convenience.
Thanks.
Sara
