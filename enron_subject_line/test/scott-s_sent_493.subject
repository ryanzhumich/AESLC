Hey Chris,  I was wondering if there was a fax number at the base so that my apartment  complex can send you some info.
regarding getting your name taken off of our  lease.
If there is, just shoot me off an email with the number and I'll pass  it along to them.
Hope things are going well and that you're not too homesick with Thanksgiving  and all.
I have a feeling I will be talking to you guys tomorrow along with  both of our parents and extended family members.
Have a great holiday and  root on the Horns ( I think this is going to be a tough one).
Love,
