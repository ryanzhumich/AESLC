Susan,    Under the terms of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement, ECS is working  with the electric utility (Tri-State) to provide TW access to Tri-State's web  site for the purposes of load controlling the Gallup Station to avoid  Tri-State's system peaks.
Attached is a confidentiality agreement which  Tri-State drafted under which Tri-State will allow both TW and ECC to see  such data.
Tri-State is obviously concerned with migration of the data to  Enron's power trading groups.
The attached draft includes my comments.
I  have attached a clean and a redlined of my comments.
I thought we could get  both of our comments prior to sending back to Tri-State.
Please review and  return all your comments to me.
Thanks.
