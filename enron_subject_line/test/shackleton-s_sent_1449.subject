Jeff and Larry:  Last year, Mary Gosnell prepared a one page summary which  was used by legal and credit to target the preparation of ISDA Master  Agreements.
The summary was divided into two parts:  "Without Master  Agreements" and "With ECT Master Agreements" and included the number of  trades for the first half of the year.
It is our objective once again to put  new agreements into place and upgrade existing ECT Master Agreements to ISDA  Master Agreements.
I don't know if EOL trades have impacted the numbers this  year and I'm not sure whether we need to create a line item for EOL (I'll  leave that to your discretion).
Please let me know if you have any  questions.
Thanks.
Sara  P.S.
We were very successful in negotiating masters appearing on Mary's  list!
