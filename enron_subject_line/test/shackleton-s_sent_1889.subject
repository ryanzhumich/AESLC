Kristina:  As you may have heard, some Raptor issues have been raised to a  new level.
I have waited to further revise the confirm pending the V&E  response; Also V&E suggested edits on the confirm format for all Raptor  deals.
As you will see from Scott's memo, the unilateral right of  termination is a potential issue.
