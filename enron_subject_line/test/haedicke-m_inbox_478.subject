The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.
Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.
No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.
The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.
In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.
We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.
In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.
We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.
