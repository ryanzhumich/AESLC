Wayne,  I have modified the above contract as we discussed.
The "Customer's Agent"  language is contained in Appendix "1".
Please have the contract signed by  JER Partners, a J.E.
Robert Company and fax it back to me.
I will then have  it signed by Houston Pipe Line Company.
I have left the attachment at the  end as originally drafted until I am able to talk to Gary Lamphier.
If it is  truly correct that there are no minimum quantity obligations under the deal,  then Gary may have to reprice the $0.09 discount for the 1000/d.
I will  leave that up to Gary and you to resolve.
