Based on today's closing NYMEX prices there is $1.9 MM of price difference  between EcoElectrica's 2002 Winter Cargo Commodity Charge plus Commodity  Surcharge and the delivered cost of 83,000 CBM of LNG.
That is $5.61 vs  $4.61.
This assumes we pay a day rate of $50,000/day for the vessel, Jan '02  NYMEX is $5.41, and the FOB price for LNG is $2.66.
Let's stay in touch about the possibilty of landing a spot cargo into Puerto  Rico in January.
As we discussed, how we play this with Cabot is a big issue.
There could be an additional $4.7 MM of value that could be captured by Eco  if Cabot were unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo.
Also, let's continue to think about how we make the logistics work and how we  can get Cabot's cooperation if needed.
Also, note that Eco may need 2 cargoes of this size to make it until the  Early Spring Cargo.
