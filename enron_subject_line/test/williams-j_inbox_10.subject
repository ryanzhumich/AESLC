Widows 2000 migration will begin this week with the  physical hardware scan - 4/16 to 4/17.
The migration techs will need to  check out the hardware on every machine we use.
All laptops will need to  be brought into the office no later than 4/17.
During the week of 4/16 everyone will need to make  themselves available for a profile interview, identifying unique application  uses and machine requirements, with a member of the migration team.
This  should only take 15 - 20 minutes.
The techs performing the interview  should contact you via email, if you wish to set an appointment just respond to  the email with the preferred date & time of your choice.
Appointments  will be scheduled on a first come first serve basis.
4/17 - We will need to identify two pilot users.
These should be the individuals within the group who use the most applications, our "Power Users", this will ensure that all applications are tested to their fullest extent.
All shared spreadsheets will need to be identified as excel seems to have caused the biggest problems in the past.
4/18 - 4/25  The Pilot process will last 5 business days, during which time the pilots are rolled completely to Windows 2000.
The pilots will use Notes R5 for two of these days and Outlook for the remaining 3 days.
Our desk bears the ultimate responsibility to ensure that ALL applications and spreadsheets used by the entire group have been tested.
This may require other members of the group to use the pilots machine to test applications or spreadsheets that are unique to your job.
ONLY THE PILOT USERS SHOULD LOG ON TO A WIN2000 MACHINE.
IF YOU ARE NOT A PILOT AND YOU LOG ON TO A WIN2000 MACHINE YOU WILL HAVE SEVERE NETWORK PROFILE ISSUES!
We will need to identify all directories and applications that we use so our support techs can arrange for the pilot user id to have access to everything the group uses.
